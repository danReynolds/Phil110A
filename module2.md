# Module 2
## The Existence of God

### Thomas Aquinas:
To believe in God at the time was mostly a matter of faith. Proof using rational arguments was to estimate the degree to which faith finds an additional support in reason.

The idea is to see if rationality supports the kind of faith that people of the time were already invested in.

## What Cosmological Arguments Look like:

The first three of Aquinas' *Five Ways* are versions of the cosmological argument.

* Premises: General observations about the character of natural order
* Conclusion: There must be something beyond the natural order to account for those observations.

The premises in all of the first three ways describe observable relations of *dependency.*

The strategy is to show that facts about the relationships of these dependencies concludes that there must be an *independent* being.

## Aquinas's Second Way:
The premises of the main argument:

1. In the natural world, agent causes come in series.
2. Nothing can cause itself. (An effect cannot be its own cause)
3. A series of causes can't go on forever.

Conclusion:

* There must be a **first** cause. This first cause is given the name God.

## Agent Cause
Presented in the first premise of the Second Way, what does Aquinas mean:

Also called efficient cause, agent causes are not necessarily *temporarily prior*, so prior in time, to their effects.

In a fire, a fire causes heat at the same time as it is being produced, one does not cause the other, they are produced simultaneously.

The premise that *agent causes come in series* does not imply a time series.

## Premise 2:

If something causes itself, then it precedes itself, which is not possible, therefore nothing can cause itself.

If it did cause itself, then by the definition of causation, it is to say that the second thing depends on the first for its existence. If light is causes, then it depends on something.

It could not derive from itself unless it already existed, in which cause it is causally independent and is not caused to exist.

If something has a cause, it is dependent for its existence on something other than itself.

They might not have causes, but if they are caused, they must be caused by something else.

## Premise 3

1. In any such series, an earlier member causes an intermediate and the intermediate causes the last. 

2. Additionally, eliminating a cause eliminates its effects. If we remove a cause, then the effects that would follow from that cause are also eliminated.

3. Unless there is a first cause, there will not be a last or intermediate. The earlier causes the intermediate, if the intermediate exists, then there must have been a first.

4. But if a series of causes goes on forever, it will have no distinct first cause, and so no intermediate causes and no last effect which is false. Contradiction.

5. **Conclusion:** It is then not infinite as it has a first cause.

## Possible Objections
There must be a first cause, which is given the name God. But then what caused God? If the natural order is causally sequenced, and if God is in that order, *what caused God?*

God is not part of the causal ordering of nature, he exists on a different level.

*If nothing caused God, did God cause itself?* By being a first cause, God does not have a cause and is not causally created, distinguishing God from the sequence of natural beings.

*Why does the first cause have to be God?* The order of the universe has to be guided by some intelligence. Then if this is true, there is an intelligent first cause.

If there is good in the world, Aquinas says, then there must be some ultimately good things.

Putting together all of Aquinas's arguments, it becomes more plausible that there is an intelligent God.

*What if the universe always existed?* The notion of an agent cause isn't necessarily a temporal notion, so if there is a first agent cause, it does not mean that this cause came first in time. A sequence of agent causes could be a sequence that has always existed.

If there was a universe that just contained a lot of oxygen and a burning candle, there is a causal sequence. The oxygen is a cause that is prior to the flame, as the flame is dependent on it. The candle flame is prior to the light the candle emits because it is dependent on the flame of the candle.

That causal ordering is still a causal sequence where things come before each other even if this universe had existed eternally. This is a non-temporal sequence, not things coming after each other but of things that existed for all time.

What he means by a first cause, he means something that is first in the order of dependencies, even if these dependencies have always and will always exist.

Objection: Aquinas hasn't adequately argued the impossibility of an infinite causal regression:

> Aquinas gives no non-question begging reason why there could not be a non-temporal infinite regress of causes. p.38

### The Fallacy of Begging the Question (Circular Reasoning)
A fallacy is a common form of bad reason. This fallacy occurs when one or more premises presuppose the truth of the conclusion that they are trying to support.

ex. There must be a God, since the Bible says that there is, and are reliable since they are divinely inspired.

This last premise that they are divinely inspired is the same as the conclusion. This is an occurrence of a fallacy begging the question.

## Does Aquinas's Second Way Beg the Question?
Begin with the third premise, that a series of causes cannot be infinite. Why does he think that a series of causes cannot go back forever? 

One of the subpremises for establishing premise 3 is that there cannot be a last or intermediate cause without a first cause. Without one that begins the process, there cannot be a subsequent cause.

Isn't that just another way of saying that a series of causes cannot go back forever? Restating premise 3? Since this is the same thing, it is circular reasoning and is not valid.

Aquinas is accused of presupposing that a series of causes cannot go back forever, thus being infinite.

## Aquinas's Third Way: The Argument from Contingency
**Contingent Beings:** Things that exist without any necessity. Things that do not have to be. 

People such as ourselves exist without any necessity. This is true as the world continued before we existed.

Premises:

1. Some things are contingent things. Things that need not be.

2. Not everything can be contingent.

3. Some things must be necessary. (Conclusion from 1 and 2)

4. A necessary being may owe its necessity to something else or only to itself.

5. A series of necessary beings cannot go on forever.

Conclusion:

Therefore there is a necessary being that owes its necessity to nothing outside of itself.

## Simplified Version of Third Way:

1. Some existing things are contingent.

2. Not everything can be contingent.

Conclusion:

Therefore, there must be a necessary being. A thing that **must** be.

The hard part is proving the second premise is true.

> For a thing that need not be was once not. - Aquinas

Therefore, if everything need not be, then there was a time when no things existed. That is an impossibility since there would still be nothing. Things cannot come from absolute nothing.

Something that does not exist can only begin to exist through something that already exists. So if everything was contingent, then at some point there was nothing and there would then be nothing now.

Therefore not everything can be contingent. Not everything is of the sort that need not be.

## Objections to the Third Way
### The Fallacy of Composition
The fallacy of arguing that because all of the parts of of a group have some characteristic, the group as a whole have this characteristic.

ex. All people are too weak to lift a 1 ton weight. Then all people together cannot lift a 1 ton weight. This is clearly a fallacy.

Where might this fallacy occur in the Third Way:

Aquinas argues that a thing that need not be once was not. Then if everything was not, once upon a time there was nothing.

If this is not necessarily true, this step in Aquinas argument is invalid.

The objection envisions the possibility that the class of contingent things always existed. Its members change over time, but there was never a time when the class of contingent things did not exist at all.

Then the class of contingent things is a necessary being. Therefore proving that not everything can be contingent.
