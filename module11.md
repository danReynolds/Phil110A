## Individuation and Identity: Locke's Theory
What makes something individual?

What is the basis for being able to chunk the world into individual objects and keep track of them?

Any individual being undergoes change over time, yet we are able to re-identify a thing at different stages of its history and say that it is the same in some ways and different in others.

It is possible to extend the identity of things over time.

What does it mean to be the same person over time?

### Individuation
What is the difference between existing as a single thing and as a *many*?

What does it mean for two things to be *qualitatively identical*?

Two pencils could be essentially the same on the basis of their internal characteristics.

They are, however, two qualitatively identical pencils that are their own separately, so their must be some difference or they would just be one thing.

How can they be differentiated into two things, not one if they have the same qualities?

Even if they share all the same qualities, surely they are made of different matter and must be two pencils rather than one?

But we can ask the same question about the materials they are made out of. What if they are exactly the same? And it recurses.

Locke answers that we are trying to look for some internal aspect of the property that accounts for their multiplicity.

Locke believes that we should look outside the pencils and look for a reference point in relation to which the two are distinguishable.

Whenever one deals with a multiplicity of things, not an individual, one can always distinguish something in spatio-temporal terms.

There will be a difference between the objects space and time values.

It is impossible that two things of the same kind can exist in the same place at the same time.

A given individual can occupy only one place at a time.

Anything that is an individual can only occupy one place at a time.

What individuates a pencil for Locke is the spatio-temporal history of an object. No other thing has the same history as a particular individual pencil.

Whenever you find things with distinct spatio-temporal histories, you can be sure you are dealing with a multiplicity.

A specific spatio-temporal history will define its individuality.

An individual to Locke is an individual because of where it has been and when.

Matter that constitutes a baby isn't matter that constitutes an adult. On the basis of growth, size, appearance, there are new things that simply did not exist before.

Most of what the adult is did not even exist when the baby existed, so how can one say that these are the same individuals?

The adult must have originated at a different time from the child since they have varying matter and periods of existence.

How can one say of a given thing `x` that it is the same at given times considering the radical changes that can occur to `x` over the course of its history?

In what sense are we justified in saying that a child and an adult are identical? How are they numerically identical?

How do we reidentify a baby with an adult and being able to make these identifications given the radical change that an individual can undergo?

This is the issue of identity over time.

On what basis is the child and the adult the same? Why don't we say that they are in fact different?

It is tempting to consider them two different things. Nearly all of the matter differs, so why aren't there two different ones?

### Locke's Response to Identity Over Time
Questions about identity over time are potentially ambiguous. If they are simply collections of material parts, they are clearly different.

Now consider the adult and the child as people. Are the child and the adult the same person? It is clearly true that they are.

Answers to questions concerning identity over time depend on how the entities are perceived. Identity is suited to the idea. The question of whether two things are the same at one stage to the next *depends on how one looks at it.*

For Locke, there are different criteria of identity associated with different perspectives when looking at entities.

Bodies are one way of categorizing people, as packages of matter. There are also organisms of particular kinds, like plants and animals. They are both bodies and organisms. Biological entities with certain processes and functions.

Locke categorizes:
1) Bodies (based on mass)
2) Organisms (organization of parts that do certain processes and functions)
3) Human Beings (organisms of a particular species)
4) Persons (unique, individual beings with personalities)

### Bodies
Each of these ideas are ideas that in some sense apply to us. Are we the same body at time `A` and at time `B`. A body is just a material substance, so to be the same body over time is to be the same mass over time and is not possible.

### Organisms
It is the same organism over history if it has the same organization of parts, even if different mass over time. The same organization has been sustained over the course of its life. The child and adult are not the same body based on mass, but they are the same organization of life over the course of its existence.

### Human Beings
To be the same being over time, it is to be a specific kind of biological organism. It is to be an organism of the a particular species. One's parts can change, as long as they sustain the same function as sustain the same life. This is essentially the same as dealing with organisms.

One is identical to their two-year-old version when considered as a human being because they have the same parts that distinguish them as biological life throughout.

### Persons
Above all other beings, we are selves. We are persons. To be the same person over time is different from being the same being.

## Personal Identity (Locke)
Is a person one and the same as they were a year ago?

This is an ambiguous question that depends on how one is thinking of the being. If the being is thought of as a **body**, then no.

Considering that thing as a **human being**, you are the same because you are still of species homosapien and are an intelligent person with a certain physical organization of parts that has sustained you.

But are you one and the same **person** as you were a year ago?

For Locke, being the same person is different from being the same being. If a person is in a coma, they are the same human being because their biological life persists. They still live.

But they are not the same person. The individual's personality is so impaired that it is difficult to consider them to be the same person.

The person you once new is gone.

Also consider amnesia, is this the same person? Their body is certainly the same, but do they not act and think in ways radically different than previously?

The person before the amnesia episode and the person after have no continuity between them, and it seems better to divide them into separate people.

The moments in the life of a person must coalesce into a kind of unity and in amnesia or split personality, there is a break in this consistency. It is difficult to consider this the same person over time.

## What is a person?
Locke says that a person is:

> A thinking, intelligent being that has reason and reflection and can consider itself as itself in different times and places.

A person with amnesia cannot consider his or her past self as his or herself and therefore is not the same person.

So what makes you one and the same over time? What is the integration of experiences that makes this criterion for being a person over time?

### Personal Identity
Locke's Criterion of Personal Identity:

For Locke,

> A variety of experiences of time constitutes a single person if the experiences are or can be united in one consciousness.

You have to be able to extend one's consciousness to these experiences over time.

> As far as this consciousness can be extended backwards to any past action or thought, so far reaches the identity of that person; it is the same self now as it was then.

This is memory consciousness, or memory criterion of personal identity. You are the same person as you were the same person as you were a year ago just as you are able to remember your past thoughts and actions.

You are consciously able to understand and recall your past experiences. You are the same person you were as you were before if you can recall and relate to your past events.

This is a psychological criterion. It is the capacity to to bring to memory your past experiences and thoughts.

Locke's criterion implies that there must be a difference between being the same person over time and being the same *man* over time.

The criterion for being a man is not psychological. You can sustain the life and organization of material parts without considering one's consciousness. Being a man does not require consciousness, only life.

**Being a person adds consciousness.**

It is therefore logically possible that the same person can exist in more than one body because being a person is dependent on one's consciousness, one's connection to one's past events and choices.

Bodies don't matter to personal identity.

Locke's view seems to imply that experiences that have escaped one's memory are irretrievable and are *not your experiences.*

This seems incorrect. A person should be held responsible for past experiences even if they cannot remember them.

A sober person would be a different person than a drunk person. Moral responsibility is a serious issue with this definition of the person. 

To Locke, a lost memory really does belong to a different person. Those experiences belong to the same man, because physically, it was the same biological organism that executed those actions, and that the man should be held responsible, not the person.

The person is separated from the lost memories.

## Pros:
Locke explains how a group of past experiences unites to constitute a unified self. We are our past experiences. We are a person based on the past thoughts and actions we can consciously recall and learn from.

We remember our own past thoughts and actions better than we remember others. We are closely connected to our own past thoughts and actions.

## Cons:
Locke's criterion is based on past thoughts and actions, but how many of them do we actually remember? Explicitly, we actually remember very little. Many events are lost. Are we just discrete points that we remember? Is that all that makes us ourselves?

Does that mean we were not ourselves until an age when we can remember? I am only a quarter of the person I could be by count of memorable experience. Most of my days are merged and indistinguishable.

Our selfhood will be limited by our memory capacity. This is infact very limiting.

There are good features of the view, and problematic features of the view.

Are we the psychological continuity of our past experiences and memories?

There must be a looser form of psychological continuity that establishes personhood.

**How about a linked-list with days? Recalling the yesterday version of oneself links with the one before that and so on. This keeps you held together as a person.**
