## A Thought Experiment on Personal Identity
Parfit aims to show that the notion of personal identity is overrated.

It leads to an overblown sense of self-concern. Egoism concern for one's *own* future and death.

The central thought experiment:

Consider the case of a brain surgery where two lobes of your brain are detached and put in separate bodies.

Each of the resulting people X and Y remembers your experiences and has your character traits.

Both of these people are psychologically continuous with you. Both can think about your past experiences.

If personal identity is determined by psychological continuity, then what has happened to you?

There are three possible answers to this question:

1) You didn't survive the operation. There are two people now, neither of which are both.

2) You survived the operation, but as one of the two people that resulted from it.

3) You survived the operation as both X and Y

If you were transplanted to one other body, then you survived in that one body.

So if you were transplanted to both, are you not both people? You share continuous past experience and consciousness.

It would additionally seem arbitrary to select one if you were transplanted to both. How do you determine why you should survive in one but not the other? What is that special distinction?

If you survived in both, how could you continue to survive in both if their lives in experiences diverge after the transplant. Immediately after you would then have two lines of experience. That is impossible because each would only have continuous experience of their own, breaking the definition of a person.

What if X kills Y? Are you killing yourself? Do you live on after one dies?

Parfit decides that

> failure to arrive at a good answer to the question of your survival results from an undue emphasis on *identity*.

It is wrong to simply equate the notion of survival on one hand with continued identity. 

Parfit wants to say that we can and should separate the notion of survival and identity.

There is a sense in which you do survive the operation, in accordance with psychological continuity.

But the resulting persons aren't actually identical to you. **Psychological continuity** is **not** sufficient for identity.

You can say that you survive as two people but those two people are not you. You die as a person.

The notion of survival potentially effects how we think of our relationships to our own future. 

You are more connected to the person you were yesterday than the person you were a year ago.

There are also past versions of ourselves, like early childhood that bear no psychological connection.

Then imagine immortal beings with bad memories. Have they lived many different lives as people if being a person is dependent on psychological continuity of experience?

They would not be able to be the same person as they were very long ago.

Are the selves in your remote past *you*? Are they actually identical with you?

Are you a survivor of that child's life? Is that child really you?

Parfit moves to deflate the importance of the notion of personal identity.

Parfit argues that you could say that if you wanted, there are chains of psychological chains of continuity via the linked-list going back day by day.

Parfit believes that it is fine for you to say that you 'lived in France for a year as a kid' is allowed, but given that there are no substantial psychological connections between them and yourself, there might be better and less misleading ways of speaking.

It was not *I* who did that, I am different than that person. It was an *earlier self.* You are not implying that you are identical, you are different and less misleading.

The first way of talking implies identity, you're using *I*. The second doesn't, it specifies a *past self* indicating that you have changed.

Parfit's view is that you can speak either way.

This shows that identity as such doesn't really matter.

They are different ways of expressing the important thing, which is the degree of psychological connection. That through **some link**, you were connected to this past person.

The notion of identity doesn't matter. Both these ways of speaking are just ways of talking about the continuity you have with a past self. It deflates the notion of personal identity and suggests that what is important is **how you linked with a previous self**.

Whether that previous self is **identical** with you or an **ealier version** of you are just different ways of expressing your psychological connection.

### Consequences
If some of my past and future selves are only marginally connected with my present self, then I will be less self-interested. 

We are no-longer inclined to think of a future self as the same as our current self. Don't plan ahead because we don't care, that is not me in the future, they are different because of their different psychological continuity.

1. I then become focused on who I am now. Additionally, I have less reason to fear death. The person who dies years ahead is not me.

2. The version that dies is only loosely connected with me and not myself here today.

3. There is also less reason to regret time lost. If I wasted time before, then I should not care so much because that person is not me. I did not waste time, another person did. I only need to care whether I am wasting time now.

Parfit thinks that *we think less selfishly if there is less to ourselves.* We concentrate more on the present and our current lives.

We become less self-absorped.
