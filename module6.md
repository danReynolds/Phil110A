## G.E. Moore's Proof of an External World
Skeptics would say that we cannot know anything about the external world and should not try to.

Descartes Rationalism: We can know the external world, but only if we prove it, specifically overcoming the issues of:

1. Dreaming.
2. Show that God exists and that he would not deceive us.

Berkeley's Idealism: We can know the external world only if the world reduces to ideas in the minds of perceivers.

## Moore's Proof of An External World
1. Here is one hand, and here is another (premise)
2. Therefore, two hands exist at this moment (conclusion)

How is this conclusive? By waving his hand he attempts to justify that since this is an example of an external object, it must exist.

* The proof is logically flawless. The premise is different from the conclusion.
* The conclusion logically follows from the premise.
* The premise was one that Moore knew to be true.

No begging of the question, looks logically sound according to Moore.

## The Defense
Moore knows that philosophers will doubt his proof. There is no proof provided for his premise.

Descartes would argue for example that you do not know that you are not dreaming and cannot justify this premise.

Moore responds by stating that he cannot prove the premise. There is no proof possible for the existence of external things by having to prove this premise, it is not possible.

Proving the premise would require for example that he isn't dreaming. You cannot come up with an argument to show this. If Moore must prove his premise, he cannot do that.

Moore's main point is to argue against a certain view of what knowledge requires. For anything that a person claims to know, in order to know it, you must be able to give a proof of it.

Knowledge always requires proof. But what Moore wants to say is that this is a mistaken view of knowledge.

You can know things that you cannot prove. There are thing you can know that you do not need to be able to prove to know.

Moore is a *common-sense* philosopher. For Moore, the claims of common sense are more secure than the arguments that philosophers use to challenge them.

Skeptical arguments like Descartes lose to common sense knowledge like his proof above.

Should common sense knowledge have this special privilege? 

All arguments have to start with common sense. It should be the respected base of an argument.

## Contemporary Epistemology
Roderick Chrisholm's *Problem of the Criterion* (1982)

1. What do we know? Which beliefs count as knowledge and which don't?
2. How do we decide whether we know? What are the criteria for deciding which beliefs are actually knowledge?

The problem of the *diallelus*:

You need criteria for question 2. The criteria must be things we know. We don't know anything unless we answer question 1. We need to answer question 1. We need criteria to answer question 1. We need to answer question 2. Paradox.

Approaches to address this issue:

1. Skepticism: To a skeptic, this problem is unsolvable. It becomes impossible to know anything.

2. Methodism:
 * start by adopting a set of general criteria for knowledge and then answer question 1 by applying the criteria. The general criterion take's priority in the methodist approach.
* For example, use Locke's sensory experience as the criterion for knowledge. We know what we sense.

3. Particularism:
* Begin by answering question 1, not question 2. Identify certain beliefs as knowledge and then extrapolate from these beliefs to determine a criterion for question 2. You need to distinguish some beliefs first before possibly trying to establish a criterion for general knowledge in the future.

### The Defence of Particularism
Methodism is difficult because a criterion, by its nature is a *broad and far reaching generalization*. The criterion must be based on a belief, and without that stock of beliefs it is *arbitrary* to start with some random criteria.

Starting with a general criterion seems arbitrary without particular cases and beliefs to justify that criteria.

Additionally, if you start with criteria, some good beliefs might be excluded by this arbitrary criteria. Genuine cases of knowledge could be lost.

If a theory of knowledge sacrifices too many beliefs that are obviously true, then this theory should be rejected.

Therefore, favour particularism.

### Particularism
Certain particular knowledge claims serve as starting points for general theories, such as Moore's *here is one hand*.

Start with the beliefs that are common sense, that are generally true to everyone.

Any good theory should accept common sense claims and then extrapolate from these *particular cases.*

The things that one hears and sees are generally trustworthy and should be treated as particular cases of knowledge. Common sense vouches for these beliefs except for the philosophical issues like those created by Descartes.

What about errors? (Hallucinations, illusions, dreams).

Just because we can be deceived by these things doesn't mean it is likely. We just need to give allowances to these special cases.

Conclusion:

1. Normally we should trust our senses.
2. Occasionally there will be exceptions to 1.

Moving from the particular cases to a general criterion:

It is more reasonable, according to Saint Augustine, to trust the senses than to distrust them **unless** there is a particular reason to distrust them.

The criterion is developed in response to the knowledge points we normally know to be commonly and obviously true.

Consider Moore as a particularist. In order to have any theory of knowledge, we need starting points. Common sense is a good starting point. Moore is a particularist who doesn't formulate general criteria for knowledge. He is a particularist only in that he believes there are certain things, our senses, that we can just trust.

The skeptic approach cannot be answered without begging the question. Skepticism is just one of three possible approaches and particularism is another one.

Epistemology must take some things for granted in order to get started.

### Ludwig Wittgenstein On Certainty
His main interest was the *Philosophy of Language.*

A proper understanding of language and its practical uses would make philosophical problems disappear.

Language Games:

* Activities that are carried out in language.
* Promising, questioning, giving answers, making inquiries, informing, expressing hopes, proving things, are forms of language games.

He is going to show that the philosophical problem of the external world is a **invalid problem.**

### Knowledge Claims and Contexts
When a person says they know something, it is to suggest that they have verified it to be true. It is an attempt to assure a person that they have checked the knowledge's validity.

There must be the possibility of a mistake, but a knowledge claim suggests that there have been measures taken to avoid this possible mistake.

To say that one *knows* is to give an assurance that no mistake has been made.

Wittgenstein says that knowledge claims like these always have a possibility of being wrong, or being sure. The point of saying *I know* is to resolve the possibilities of doubt that might have been there initially.

WG's example of a context where Moore's existence of two hands is valid could be the following:

> If I don't know whether someone has two hands, say whether they have been amputated or not, I shall believe his assurance that he has two hands if he is trustworthy. And if he says he knows it, that can only signify to me that he has been able to make sure, and hence that his arms are not still concealed by coverings or bandages.


To say that one knows something is to mean that one has taken the relevant checks.

Moore's mistake according to WT is treating knowledge claims as though they made sense independently of context. 

He has extracted a reasonable linguistic practice of issuing knowledge claims and has transplanted them into philosophical contexts that are difficult to apply.

WT thinks that Moore is being inappropriate in speaking of knowledge like this. But he also believes idealists and skeptics are also wrong.

WT says:

> The idealist's question would be something like: What right have I not to doubt the existence of my hands... But someone who asks such a question is overlooking the fact that a doubt about existence only works in a language-game. Hence that we should first have to ask: what would such a doubt be like? and don't understand straight off

Both sides of the debate over the external world are on the wrong track. The common sense realists like Moore and the idealists are both playing a language-game.

Common sense beliefs have a special role in belief systems and outlooks. Human belief systems include some beliefs that we treat as immune to revision. 

WT characterizes these beliefs as rules not to be manipulated. They are *rocks in a river bed along which the water moves.* These beliefs are not to be argued, they are the rules of the game, not the subject of it.

> It is not a matter of Moore's knowing there's a hand, but rather we should not understand him if he were to say he may be wrong about this. We should ask, what is it to make a mistake such as that?

The certainty of these beliefs is a special kind. They have a fixed status, an anthropological fact. It is part of understanding our language-games to not push these beliefs around. It is a background we inherited. 

It is passed from generation to generation with little modification as compared with the other kinds of beliefs.
