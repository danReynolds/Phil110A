## G.E. Moore's Proof of an External World
Skeptics would say that we cannot know anything about the external world and should not try to.

Descartes Rationalism: We can know the external world, but only if we prove it, specifically overcoming the issues of:

1. Dreaming.
2. Show that God exists and that he would not deceive us.

Berkeley's Idealism: We can know the external world only if the world reduces to ideas in the minds of perceivers.

## Moore's Proof of An External World
1. Here is one hand, and here is another (premise)
2. Therefore, two hands exist at this moment (conclusion)

How is this conclusive? By waving his hand he attempts to justify that since this is an example of an external object, it must exist.

* The proof is logically flawless. The premise is different from the conclusion.
* The conclusion logically follows from the premise.
* The premise was one that Moore knew to be true.

No begging of the question, looks logically sound according to Moore.

## The Defense
Moore knows that philosophers will doubt his proof. There is no proof provided for his premise.

Descartes would argue for example that you do not know that you are not dreaming and cannot justify this premise.

Moore responds by stating that he cannot prove the premise. There is no proof possible for the existence of external things by having to prove this premise, it is not possible.

Proving the premise would require for example that he isn't dreaming. You cannot come up with an argument to show this. If Moore must prove his premise, he cannot do that.

Moore's main point is to argue against a certain view of what knowledge requires. For anything that a person claims to know, in order to know it, you must be able to give a proof of it.

Knowledge always requires proof. But what Moore wants to say is that this is a mistaken view of knowledge.

You can know things that you cannot prove. There are thing you can know that you do not need to be able to prove to know.

Moore is a *common-sense* philosopher. For Moore, the claims of common sense are more secure than the arguments that philosophers use to challenge them.

Skeptical arguments like Descartes lose to common sense knowledge like his proof above.

Should common sense knowledge have this special privilege? 

All arguments have to start with common sense. It should be the respected base of an argument.
