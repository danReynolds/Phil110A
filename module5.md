# Module 5
## Berkeley's Epistemology
Believes that we perceive things by sense similar to Locke. What we immediately perceive are *sensible things*.

Sensible things are collections of sensible qualities (shapes, sizes, colours, sounds, smells, feels).

Our knowledge of our minds derives from *reflective* experience.

## Berkeley's Metaphysics
### Idealism
Only minds and their ideals exist.

**Immaterialism:** There is no such thing as matter, or material substance.

Argues against the view that if there were no minds in the world to perceive it, there would still be a realm of material things. The external world is mind-dependent.

Being perceived by a mind is essential for an object's existence. Berkeley answer to the tree in the forest is that the tree does not make a sound because for a sound to exist, it must exist in some mind. Not even the tree exists.

**Idealist Slogan**: To be is to be perceived. *Esse est percipi*.

Is this crazy? Berkeley argues that this view is far less crazy than the alternatives. 

Both Locke and Descartes have dealt with the possibility between our internal sensory information and the objects that populate the external world.

Neither Descartes and Locke are idealists and must distinguish how we can trust our sensory inputs. If all we ever have is our sensory perceptions, how can there be a world beyond those sensations?

This problem is the *Veil of Perception*. Our sensory inputs are limiting us, one cannot see beyond them to see objects in full.

If Idealism is true, Berkeley's metaphysics eliminates the problem of the Veil of Perception. There is no mind-independent world beyond our own perception.

If Idealism is true, all we have is the world of ideas. There is nothing that the mind cannot perceive.

If a person is a materialist who believes in a realm beyond the mind, then it is a world that cannot be discovered because of the limitations of our own perception. This ultimately leads to skepticism.

Berkeley maintains that the idealist option does not lead to skepticism. By making the world of ideas, it is a world that can actually be known and does not have the problems of Locke or Descartes.

In his *Dialogue* he has two characters:
1. Hylas:
* Defends the thesis of mind-independent material world.
* Maintains that the idealist position is a form of skepticism and should be rejected.
2. Philonus (Hero):
* Maintains that idealism is not skepticism
* Argues that it is the materialist view that leads to skepticism.
* Argues that the very notion of a material realm is what inevitably leads to skepticism.

At the beginning of the dialogue there are key points of agreement:

* What we immediately perceive are sensible things.
* Sensible things are collections of sensible qualities (shapes, sizes, colours, sounds, smells, feels).

The list of sensible qualities includes both primary and secondary qualities as defined by Locke.

Berkeley's work is a critique of Locke's. His philosophy of material objects is a negative target for Berkeley's arguments.

Through Philonus, Berkeley argues that sensible qualities exist only in minds. A very great heat is perceived as a pain and pain is only existent in minds that perceive them. Therefore a quality like heat is mind-dependent.

## Arguments From Perceptual Relativity
The perceived qualities of objects vary with changes in the conditions of perception and/or the perceiver.

For example, in certain circumstances, the same object can feel both hot and cold to the touch. If you have a hand in warm water and a hand in cold water, a tepid object will feel differently. Now which is it, is the object warm or cold?

No object can have opposing qualities simultaneously. The heat and the cold cannot be features of the object, rather they are features of one's own perception of the object, since no object can be both hot and cold.

Berkeley says that those qualities are sensory ideas in the perceiver, rather than qualities of the object itself.

Therefore the qualities revealed in our sensory processes are mind-dependent qualities just as in the sense that heat and cold are.

Heat and cold were examples of secondary qualities according to Locke. Locke himself suggested that there was a subjectivity and mind-dependence of the secondary qualities.

While so far nothing Berkeley's Philonus has said is different to Locke, Berkeley says that this reasoning also applies to the primary qualities.

While Locke thought that these qualities existed independent of perception and that they are causes of ideas. He says that the ideas we have in our minds are resemblances of these real external objects.

Berkeley's Philonus' strategy is to show that the perceptual relativity arguments are equally effective at showing the mind-dependence of primary qualities.

If Berkeley can show this to be true, then this is a serious criticism of the Locke materialism view of the world.

He uses the same style of Perceptual Relativity arguments as with heat. He argues that if you consider the extension/size of an object, this varies as you approach or recede from an object.

Since it cannot have all these sizes at once, this must be a perceived quality that bares the same kind of mind-dependence.

An object like a marble will look very different under a microscope. If you look at an object with one eye naked and one eye under a microscope you see the object as two forms. Therefore these are also perceived qualities because they cannot have multiple states.

Whenever we talk about the qualities that objects possess, it turns out that all primary qualities as well are for Berkeley also mind-dependent.

There is no distinction to be made between the qualities and the sensations (ideas) we have of them. The sensations should show that there really is no distinction to be made between the size and shape. Sizes just are ideas of sizes. Shapes just are ideas of shapes. Object in reality do not have some pure actual shape.

This style of perceptual relativity argument aims to show that everything in the world is mind-dependent.

### Berkeley vs Locke
Both believe in Empiricism in epistemology. We know things through our experiences.

His points of disagreement are with metaphysics. Locke's metaphysics is materialistic. He believes in a material realm and it is information about that material realm that is picked up through our sensory processes.

Berkeley, in contract argues against all materialism. He defends idealism.

Hylas concedes Philonous's (Berkeley's) arguments for mind-dependence of sensible qualities. But Hylas maintains that there are mind-independent material objects. He has not conceded that the objects themselves are equally mind-dependent.

Hylas suggests that there is a layer of the world untouched by Philonous's mind-dependence. This is a **Material Substance** or **substratum**.

What isn't mind-dependent and what is still needed to exist mind-independently is this material.

The substratum is the stuff that underlies and supports the qualities perceived through sense. In the case of a bicycle, it has a colour and shape. Hylas suggests that qualities cannot exist on their own.

Shapes cannot exist on their own, there must be a substance adhering to that quality. Qualities can only exist when they are supported by an entity which is not a quality. There must be something that can be shaped.

The material substance that are described by sensory qualities must exist mind-independently according to Hylas.

Berkeley maintains that material substance was a large scale error. He argues that the very idea of substratum is incoherent.

He says that when philosophers talk about substratum, they don't really know what they're talking about. Objects are perceived via their qualities or accidents.

A bicycle is defined by its shape, size. You are always perceiving the qualities. What actually **is** the substratum?

It is nothing according to Berkeley. Hylas proposes that substratum is something that supports or stands under the qualities.

Pheloneous responds, if substratum stands under the qualities, it must support qualities such as extension/size. It cannot support size or be spread under size unless it were already sized. How can anything support anything unless it had a size?

It can do this only if it is already sized. But how can something already sized support being sized? Something already sized has to support sizing and this becomes a circular issue. The relationship between the substratum and the qualities become circular and the notion of material substance comes into question.

Philoneus presents Hylus with a challenge. Try to conceive of an object that is unconceived in any mind, so that it is mind-independent.

Hylas thinks this is easy. Just picture a tree or a house where no one is around to perceive it. Philonous says that he has not met the challenge because Hylas has conceived of it himself.

The idea here is that it is a self-defeating enterprise to think of something that is not thought of. This is the master argument.

Try to picture something that isn't pictured in any mind. You always come up with the picture in your own mind.

There is no entity that is not conceived in a mind. Berkeley rests his entire case on this master argument.

### Representationalism
Our sensory conceptions are inner representations, semblances of material objects. The material objects are not something we can know or sense directly.

Philonous's (Berkeley's argument):

The idea that there is a resemblance between ideas and objects is wrong.

**Ideas:** inner objects, fleeting, variable. Sensory ideas are constantly changing.

**Material Objects:** external objects, stable, and unvarying.

How can these two things resemble one another? They seem complete opposites. Material objects are never directly made aware of, we only have indirect connection to material objects. The ideas are sensible, the material objects are not.

How could there be resemblances? Berkeley wants to suggest that the version of empiricism that goes through representationalism is incorrect. If he is correct, then his idealist view must deny a good part of the real world.

Does Berkeley's view deny the reality of things thought to be real?

Does his view deny that there are other human bodies, other objects? No. Rather Berkeley is insisting that there existence must be analyzed in idealist terms.

For Berkeley, a tree is a collection of tactile, visual, sensations when you look at the tree. We do not deny that these objects exist, only that we need to understand their existence in a particular way to philosophically understand what they are.

One of the problems for this kind of view of thinking of objects as collections of ideas is that there can be nothing beyond what occurs in one's own mind. Are the only real things the things in our own minds?

Berkeley is not a solipsist, a person who believes that the entire world is within a single mind. He can say this because there are minds other than one's own.

What then is cause and effect? The tree fell. How did it fall? This event must have occurred and was not in anyone's mind.

Also, trees and objects don't cease to exist when people are not looking at them. The reason he wants to maintain this view is because he believes that the whole world of ideas is preserved by God.

The world of ideas was God's gift to human beings. God persists these ideas when no human mind experiences them.

The world is God's creation and is understandable. Objects exist in the environment when not perceived, such as when everyone is fast asleep, that doesn't meant that the external objects have disappeared because it still exists in God's mind.

This is a bit unfair in my opinion. Suddenly everything exists all the time.

Then what is the different between materialism and idealism?

Berkeley wants to insist that there is no thing that exists in no mind whatsoever. It has to exist in some mind, even in God's mind. He insists upon this because the notion of a material substance not existing in any mind is incomprehensible.

There is no such confusion if a person drops the assumption that there is mind-independent matter. The world of the idealist can be well understood and appreciated without the paradoxes that occur when we consider mind-independent materials.
