# Module 8
## Determinism:
All events are caused by other prior events. Every event has a causal ancestry.

All events are governed by causal laws.

Causes necessitate their effects.

Human actions are just one kind of event. As an event it is covered by all other principles being maintained. It is caused by prior events and governed by causal laws, and the causes of the action necessitate that decision.

How then can there be human freedom? The determinist picture seems incompatible with human freedom.

If someone performs action A *freely*, it must have been possible for the person to *not* perform A. Free actions involve alternative possibilities.

If:

1. Human actions are caused by other events
2. Causes necessitate their effects, then there are no alternative possibilities.

For any action you take, it will be true that you could not have done otherwise.

Why Determinism is important:

It has consequences for **moral responsibility.** 

Holding people responsible for something very bad presupposes that they did it of their own accord. They could have done good but they chose bad.

We only hold people responsible when there were alternative choices. If they had no choice then we don't hold them responsible.

Killing someone on purpose is a crime, by accident or as a result of someone else is not.

If determinism is true and every event is a piece in a chain of dominos, then it is hard to believe that there are alternative actions to those we perform.

It is hard to believe in human freedom if you believe in determinism.

Indeterminist view: Human decision are uncaused.

The argument against indeterminism, nothing causes anything, is that if an action is uncaused, then it is purely spontaneous, and nothing was reponsible.

If nothing is responsible for bringing the action in to effect, then the agent isn't responsible. No-one chooses any action, they just act purely spontaneously for no reason.

Therefore both determinism and indeterminism are incompatible with human freedom.

### A third possibility:
Free actions are not caused (determinism) or uncaused by prior events (undeterminism).

**Chisholm's agency view:** Free actions are caused by people/agents. If a person acts freely, then that person is the cause of the action. Nothing causes the agent to choose/act. The beginning of the chain is the person. A free action is a person's action.

The determinist chain goes on as event A causing event B causing event C...

An action would be causally determined by an infinite chain of events.

Chisholm's agency view has the following procedure:

1. You are the root cause: event A
2. You cause yourself to make a decision: event B
3. You act on your decision: event C

There is nothing that causes you to bring about a decision. Since nothing caused you to bring about event B, you could have caused an alternative B'.

## The Agency View Continued
Consider a person who moves a rock with a stick. The rock moved because the stick moved. The hand moved because the person's muscles move. The person's muscle moved because the person's brain told it to move.

This is **Transeunt Causation**: ordinary physical causation where an event is caused by other events.

For freedom to be possible, there has to be one special kind of event prior to all others that cause the action. The brain event must have been caused by an agent.

It must be the case that the agent was not caused to do so by any prior event.

Transeunt causation from the person to the motion of the rock are compatible with determinism.

For Chisholm, if freedom is possible, there must be one prior event that ultimately results in the action:

The brain event must have been caused by an agent, a person, who was not caused to do so by any prior event. If they were caused by some prior event then they were not free to make their action, they were forced into it.

For freedom to be possible:

1. The brain event must have been caused by an agent.
2. The agent was not caused by any prior event.

This is *Immanent Causation*. Cases where an event is caused by an agent.

Things are caused, but there is a root cause, called an agent, that beings the chain of actions.

Chisholm makes a compromise between determinism and indeterminism. There are problems with this view.

### Problems
Chisholm introduces agents as a special kind of cause unlike ordinary physical causes.

If you want your explanation of causation to be simple, the idea that there is a special type of cause is difficult.

Immanent causation is mysterious. Even if there are agents with special causal properties, what are these properties in agents? It adds another layer of convolution.

## Compatibilism
Compatibilist approaches to Freedom and Determinism suggest that freedom can be reconciled with Determinism.

Ayer's piece called *Freedon and Necessity* where he contrasts the notions of **Constraint vs Causation**. Constraint goes against freedom and shows that freedom is compatible with deterministic freedom.

Why be a compatibilist?

The notion of freedom is mysterious if we don't see human action as explicable in causal terms.

What would it mean to say that a person's actions aren't governed by causal laws?

It would imply that actions are a mere matter of chance and thus entirely unpredictable.

This can't be freedom because if it was random then it wasn't a choice.

Ayer is addressing the moralist:

The moralist's views:

The relevant notion of freedom isn't that actions are a mere matter of chance, but that free actions are caused by free choices.

Ayer's reply:

Well then are our choices causally determined? If not then they are a mere matter of chance. Even if we as agents make choices, if they aren't caused by something then they are random and a matter of chance.

If our choices are causally determined, then we are back to determinism applied to our choices.

Ayer decides that we should accept causal dependency and make that a part of how we explain human actions.

We need a notion of freedom that reconciles with the determinist view of the causal structure of the world.

Embed human actions in the deterministic framework.

Ayer's view:

Freedom is mysterious if it cannot be reconciled with determinism.

Ayer's argument:

The incompatibilist position, that freedom and determinism don't go together, starts with a type of contrast between freedom and causality and suggests that when actions are caused by prior events, that action is not free.

Ayer challenges that freedom and causality are incompatible. Free doesn't mean *uncaused*.

To call an action free is to call it *unconstrained.*

Examples of constraint:

1. **Coercion:**
When someone is compelled to do something, ex. gun to the head, brainwashed. The decision is out of the person's hands.

2. **Habitual Compulsion:**
The kleptomaniac (someone compelled to steal things), these are constraints. No amount of thinking or wishing otherwise could prevent a person from doing this.

Actions taken under constraint minimize the causal role of our choices. Whatever one would ordinarily decide would be overridden by the constraint.

Had the constraint not been present, the agent may have chosen differently.

Actions are free when they result from *unconstrained choices.*

The question of whether or not our choices/actions are constrained is independent of the question whether or not they are caused.

Actions can be unconstrained even if they are caused.

When you chose breakfast, were you constrained in what you chose?

No. There was no habitual compulsion, or party forcing this action.

This doesn't mean that your choices weren't caused. Just because it wasn't constrained doesn't mean it wasn't caused.

There were prior causes such as what I felt like relative to what I have recently ate. There were factors from environment, natural inclination, all types of causes.

*The idea that freedom and determinism as incompatible is wrong. Freedom doesn't contrast with causality, freedom contrasts instead with constraint and freedom is therefore compatible with causality.*

Actions that aren't constrained may nevertheless be caused by different factors.

This is more logical and simple that Chisholm's Immanent Causation.

Moral responsibility presupposes that agents have options. To be held responsible, you have to have had a choice and been able to do more than one thing.

If compatibilism is true, are there alternative options? Causal determinism is a part of compatibilism. These are determined by prior causes, and in causal processes, causes always necessitate effects.

Then how can there be alternative possibilities available to us. It doesn't seem then that there are alternative possibilities to our decisions.

If our decisions are causally determined by prior events, how can there be alternative possibilites?

### Alternative Possibilities
If determinism is true, then it necessitates actions. In the compatibilist view, freedom and morality go hand in hand.

If you can only do one thing, then you cannot be held morally responsible for an action.

Moral responsibility seems to presuppose that moral agents have alternative possibilities.

Harry Frankfurt argues that moral responsibility does not presuppose that we have alternative options available to us when we choose to act.

Frankfurt asks us whether or not alternative possibilities really do matter.

The notion of moral responsibility does not pre-suppose alternative possibilities.

### Frankfurt's Thought Experiment:
they are not like real experiments, they do not involve observation or equipment, they do not involve any empirical results.

They try to draw some lessons from the details of a built up scenario.

The details of the scenario prompt us to make a judgement based on things we already know.

The judgement about the hypothetical example leads us to clarify, or change our view of a particular concept or idea.

In order to be held responsible for an action, it must have been the case that one could have done otherwise.

In Frankfurt's thought experiment, character Black is doing everything he can to make sure character Jones never makes a decision Black does not agree with.

Black is able to influence jones using hypnotism. Black can force Jones to do the things that Black wants.

Imagine that by coincidence that Jones never does anything that Black doesn't want him to do. They're just so in sync.

Then Black never has to use his special powers to influence Jones. 

### Frankfurt's View:
Under these circumstances, Jones is responsible for his actions. Black never forces Jones to do something. He does what he wants to do. Jones is fully responsible and morally accountable for his actions because it was his decisions that led to them.

Black's powers never had an impact on Jones.

Note that Jones didn't have any alternative options. Black was there and would have prevented Jones from doing anything else. Any attempt of Jones' to deviate would fail.

### Main Argument:
Jones is morally responsible for his actions because Black never used his powers.

Jones had no alternative possibilities and had he chosen differently Black would have forced him back.

Therefore, the conclusion is that moral responsibility does not presuppose alternative possibilities.

I really don't like this because he still had alternative possibilities, he just would have been stopped. He could have tried them but they would have failed but that doesn't mean he didn't have them.

Back to Frankfurt, what's important are who's motives are behind the action, not what action actually took place and whether there were alternative options.

If Jones killed someone without Black's influence, it is Jones' fault. If Black hypnotized him, it would have been Black's fault.

Moral responsibility is dependent on whose **motives** were in play, rather than whether a person could had alternative choices.

It is for this reason that Frankfurt thinks Jones is morally responsible, despite the fact that he could have attempted to choose otherwise.

Your free actions are ones that aren't coercive or influenced by some external influence, as well as not being affected by an internal compulsion.

Frankfurt's position shows that you are morally responsible for actions where your *own motives* are responsible for the action getting done.

Frankfurt does not say that he is a compatibilist, his approach is just reconcilable with compatibilism.

A free decision is unfluenced by habitual compulsions or coercion. 

*The notion of freedom compatibilism endorces is unable to accommodate alternative possibilites as a basis for moral responsibility.*

This is not a problem for compatibilism that it does not allow for alternative possibilities because according to Frankfurt, alternative possibilities are not important for moral responsibility. It is where the **motives** come from that makes an agent morally responsible.

Jones never performed an action that he did not want to do. He is responsible, even though he had no alternatives.

If this is right, then *compatibilism can be reconciled with moral responsibility. Compatibilism's inability to have multiple possibilities is not a problem for its account of moral responsibility.*

Compatibilism then does develops a notion of freedom. Reconciles it with causal determinism. Yields a useful and important conception of moral responsibility.

There is freedom, causation and moral responsibility so it all works.

1. We have a notion of freedom. Freedom is not opposite to causation, it is opposite to constraint. Your free choices can still be caused/influenced by your environment and history, which reconciles freedom with causation. 

It is just that you weren't **forced** to do something you wouldn't have done otherwise, which we call constraints.

2. Determinism and freedom can work together. We make our own choices, these choices were influenced by our history and environment, but they are ultimately our free choices as long as they are not constrained.

3. Moral responsibility and causality can be reconciled. Just because causation results in us making a certain choice and no alternative doesn't mean that there is no moral responsibility. Moral responsibility isn't about **alternative choices**, which goes against determinism, it is about the **motive** of the single choice.

We are morally responsible when the action we take, which has no alternatives, is our action as a result of our causal motives from past experience and inclination, versus someone else's. If we were the motive for that action, we are morally obligated. If it was someone else's motive that led us to that action then we are not morally responsible.

Jones only had a decision, but when he did it of his own accord he was responsible. When he did it because Black coerced him into do it then it was not his responsibility.

The motives that lead us to act are necessitated by prior causes. We are saddled with the motives we have from our causal background. The prior causes are enough to necessitate the actions we actually perform.

### Is This Freedom?

Is this a notion of freedom we can really live with? It does not leave much wiggle room. We are bound to act on the motives we have from the past. Is this freedom?

If our causal background ensures that we have motives to kill someone later, is that our fault? We chose the attributes that result in those motives years earlier, with no intention of killing anyone.

Is it freedom if we are causally necessitated to make a decision because of our past motives? We had no choice to kill them because of our motives developed over years of past events. But we did intend to commit a crime with these motives.

Whose fault is it?
