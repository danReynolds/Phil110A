# Module 9
## The Mind Body Problem
Humans exist as **mixed** beings. We have:

1. Bodies (physical, material)
2. Minds (souls, spirits)

This is the problem of trying to understand the relationship between these two components.

### Dualism
the view that the realm of the physical is ontologically distinct from the realm of the mental. **Ontology** is the branch of metaphysics dealing with *existence.*

This is to say that the mind and body exist separately.

### Substance Dualism
The human mind and body are distinct entities. Human beings are a composite entity that consist of a mind and body.

The view of Descartes is the most influential substance dualist.

Descartes knows that he has a clear and distinct perception of himself as a thinking being. What is essential to his existence is his ability to think.

He has a clear and distinct conception of his body as an extended thing.

These are separate conceptions. You can conceive of each of these things without conceiving of the other. He proved the existence of his mind without any reference to the body.

The conception of oneself as a thinking thing is one thing and the conception of oneself as a physical thing is another.

There is no mutual involvement between these conceptions.

The fact that he can clearly and distinctly understand them apart from one another is another for Descartes to know that the two things, mind and body, are **distinct.**

They must actually be two different entities and a sufficiently powerful being like God could *pull them apart.*

Therefore, Descartes, a thinking thing, is distinct from his body. The *I* is a thinking thing, and it is distinct from the body. When Descartes talks about himself, he refers to the mind, the *I*.

He believes that they go together to form a strong unity. Bodily events like pain give rise to mental experiences. Moods and thoughts can be influenced by the body.

Alternatively, mental events and decisions like eating food change the body.

### Property Dualism
The property dualist view considers individuals as having distinct ranges of properties. Both mental properties and bodily properties.

Regardless of whether individuals are composed of various entities, they at least have mental and physical properties.

Substance dualism was favoured.


### Interactionism
Mental and physical states cause one another. They are tightly-coupled.

The **interaction problem** is the problem of understanding how minds and bodies interact.

The body is a material thing governed by the causal laws of material processes. But the mind is an immaterial thing and does not seem to be able to be described by the causal laws that govern material processes.

If the brain is immaterial, how can it influence something material?

The dualist picture asks how mind stuff relates to the physical, causal picture.

The mind-body problem is a central part of the problem for the dualist.

## Mind-Brain Identity Theory (Smart)
This is an attempt to solve the mind-body problem. It denies that dualism is true. Smart's theory is that mental states and processes are nothing but states of the brain.

They are all a state of the brain, a physical state. Any mental state can be identified with a certain brain state.

Pain, a mental experience, is identified with a certain brain process, fibres in the brain that are stimulated to cause pain.

This is a denial of the dualist view, there are not two different kinds of entities, there is one kind, that can be understood with enough knowledge.

Pain, feelings are all just states of the brain. Mental states are not correlated with brain states, Identity Theory is saying that pain is the brain state.

C-fibre stimulation doesn't cause mental states of pain. It is the pain. There is no connection between two things, it is all one thing.

Brain states and processes are physical, not psychical. They have physical effects on other parts of the body.

**Occam's Razor:** Do not multiply principles beyond the need to explain. Don't drag in ad-hoc elements, just use exactly what is needed to explain something, anything more just adds confusion.

Our best scientific explanations involve only physico-chemical mechanisms. This is the direction to go in explaining psychology, like with other sciences.

> Science is increasingly giving us a viewpoint...it seems to me that even the behaviour of man himself will one day be explicable in mechanistic terms.

To suppose that the mental realm is beyond the physical is to violate Occam's razor. The dualist view of the mind makes mental states into *nomological danglers*. An unnecessary leftover of earlier ways of thinking about the mind.

They are an extraneous attempt at explaining what can be explained with physico-chemical processes. To treat mental processes as an exception to everything else is a mistake.

### Objections to Identity Theories
1. We can know our mental states without having any knowledge of brain physiology. How can that be if the brain controls the mind? Response: We know many things without understanding them, like the opinion people had about lightning hundreds of years ago.

2. Mental states are private; brain states aren't. Each person has access to their mental states. Response: we treat each person as having privileged access to their mental states but this could change with improvement of brain science.

We currently lack criteria for attributing specific mental states on the basis of specific brain activities. But this will come in time. We could make the privacy of mental states public with time.

The problem of consciousness:

Treating mental states as brain states does not capture the character of conscious experience.

Are conscious experiences something over and above material processes?

Or could experience and brain processes be the same thing? Is fear the same thing as some stimulant in the brain? Just different vocabularies?

## Pros and Cons of Identity Theory (Fodor)
Identity Theory has an advantage over Behaviourism.

* **Radical Behaviourism:** Attempts to eliminate mental states from psychology.

* Psychology should concern itself only with the causal relationship between external stimuli and behavioural responses (Skinner, etc).

I hate this, this is all external. We can gain knowledge from the beyond the experimental at this level. We can analyze the brain and deduce behaviour without behaviours.

This radical behaviourism denies that there is anything like mental causation. Psychology is all about external stimuli.

* **Logical Behaviourism:** Mental state terms are defined by behavioural hypotheticals. *I am thirsty* means that if water were available, I would drink it.

But the behaviourist approach does not explain enough. Fodor believes that identity theory improves on the behaviourist approach.

Identity theory acknowledges that mental states, therefore brain states, play causal roles in psychological processes.

The identity theory suggests that mental states are brain states. 

### Fodor's Objection to Identity Theory
Identity theory identifies types of mental states with types of brain states (Fear => pain).

Fodor considers this as a narrow view of mental states. It implies that no being that has brain physiology similar to ours can have mental states.

This is wrong, an alternative lifeform would just have their own equivalent that define mental states.

There is no *specific* type of physiology that defines mental states, but they are all defined by some physical processes that are equivalent to our mental processes.

A being with vastly different physiology still has all of the same mental states and just has different brain states that allow these mental processes.

By this same token, could a machine have brain states that allow mental states in the same way the human brain creates mental states?

Fodor believes it is chauvinistic to think that only the human brain and its makeup can have mental states.

Fodor believes we should not define mental states in terms of any particular physiology because we cannot rule out other physiologies from having mental states.

Rather similar mental states can be realized in vastly different physical systems, even possibly in machinistic systems.

Then, if we do not define mental states in terms of specific brain states, how do we define mental states?

Fodor suggests that we define mental states in terms of their **functional roles.**

For example, what is money? The idea is that money isn't a physical realization, it is the purpose it fulfils and the role it plays.

Money isn't a piece of paper, or a block of shiny metal, it is something a person can use in order to purchase objects. It is a function, it is defined by its role, not its physiology.

Define certain mental states with roles, and the functions they achieve rather than the specific brain states like C-fibres that mental states might be related to, if only in humans.

The functional roles that mental states play are the important things.

Ask what mental states do, not what they're made of.

Mental states are whatever states of the organism that play certain, particular causal roles.

### Functional Roles of Mental States:
* Beliefs (mental state):
    * Caused by sensory processes, aspects of the external environment, reasoning processes. (cause)
    * Interact with desires to produce behaviours. (effect)
* Pain sensations (mental state):
    * caused by eye strain, concussion, etc (cause). This pain sensation induces a person to take a pill or lie down (effect).

Fodor suggests that the `mental state has a -> cause and fulfils a -> role`

It differs from identity theory in that it doesn't define mental states in terms of the physical processes. It defines them in terms of the mental state's causes and effects.

Functionalism on its own is physiology independent and is not even materialistic. The mental states could be caused by immaterial causes. It is not restricted to materialism and could support even Descartes' dualist view.

Although Fodor acknowledges that in at least humans, our mental states are realized by brain states, but it does not want to define mental states in terms of brain states because of the other systems in other beings that could have mental states without brain states.

Functionalism allows brain state to mental state relationships, but it does not require them and does not define mental states in terms of brain states.

In computers, the software functions are carried out on certain hardware. Windows has a text editor, and a Mac has a text editor but they have vastly different architectures.

The mind state is the software function. They both fulfil the same role of allowing someone to edit text. The mental states are fulfilled on both, but through vastly different means.

What characterizes mental states are the functions that they provide. It doesn't matter what machine it is run on as long as you can edit text.

*Mental states are not defined by what actualizes them, but by what specific causal roles they play in the life of the being.*
