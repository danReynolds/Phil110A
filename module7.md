## Causal Reasoning (Hume)
There is a certain kind of inference that causal reasoning presupposes to be legitimate, called induction.

### An Inquiry Consuming Human Understanding
Causes necessitate certain effects, and similar causes necessitate similar effects. We form beliefs about these things appropriately using causal reasoning.

What, if anything, justifies the assumptions?

Hume's answer:

> I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect and I foresee that other objects which are in appearance similar will be attended with similar effects.

We foresee that the next piece of bread will nourish us because the bread we've had in the past has done so.

We extrapolate from what we've experienced in the past to make conclusions about the future. This is inductive inference. They involve premises that express past or present observations.

The conclusions of inductive inferences are an extrapolation from things we have observed to things we haven't observed. 

Hume's issue:

What justifies the expectations we form on the basis of past experience?

Do we have a sound rational justification for extrapolating from past experience?

Hume answers no.

Examples of inductive conclusions:

Predictions: The bread I eat tomorrow will nourish me is a prediction.

Generalizations: In all normal cases bread provides nourishment for humans.

How can premises that speak only of what we have experienced justify conclusions for things that we haven't experienced?

Hume's position:

inductive arguments provide no rational justification for their conclusions. 

Hume's Skeptical Argument:

Formal features of inductive arguments:

* Premises: Things of type A have always produced things of type B in the past. (past experience)

* Conclusions: The next time we witness something of type A, an effect of type B will be produced.

In doing this, we are appealing to the Principle of the Uniformity of Nature (PUN). *The future will be conformable to the past*.

The transition is that you can depend on the things in the past as a template for the future if the future is conformable to the past and **nature is more or less uniform**.

This is the transition that Hume argues does not always exist and is the one that is necessary.

The legitimacy of inductive inferences depends on the legitimacy of the PUN. If we can trust this, then everything goes right with inductive inference.

Hume's skeptical argument against inductive reasoning is that there is no way to prove PUN true.

How could PUN be true? It could  be true if:

1. We are able to observe the secret powers by which causes necessitate their effects. Hume denies the existence of such a power. If people did observe these powers, they wouldn't appeal to past experience.

2. Another possibility for PUN could be that it is an *a priori* principle that can be known on the basis of pure reason. Hume argues it can't be. There is nothing contradictory in the idea that the course of nature could change in the future. Denying an a priori principle would result in a contradiction. Since it is possible for the world to suddenly change and nature change, PUN is clearly not an a priori principle.

3. Or, PUN could be justified itself as an inductive generalization that has been proven to be true through inductive experience.

* In our experience, nature has been uniform and regular in its ways. (premise)

The problem with this premise as observed by Hume is that this reasoning begs the question. We need PUN as a means of justifying inductive reasoning. Without PUN, inductive reasoning doesn't work.

So proving PUN with inductive reasoning requires PUN, which hasn't yet been proven and we therefore see that it does not work.

We want PUN in order to justify PUN and that is an example of circular reasoning.

Inductive reasoning itself cannot be justified using inductive reasoning by believing in PUN.

Hume has shown that there is no reason to trust inductive arguments. The only possible reason for making the extrapolation from past to future is using PUN, but the only way to justify using PUN is to prove it using this same extrapolation and this is circular reasoning.

If there is no rational reasoning for inductive arguments, why then do people use past experiences to make inferences about the future? We routinely do.

If inductive reasoning is wrong, why then do we do and so often trust it?

Hume answers that we do this out of *habit*. It is our custom to form these expectations on the basis of past experience as a matter of mere psychological fact.

Pavlov shows that we can condition animals to associate certain one thing with a particular response. There is no connection other than the false one Pavlov has generated. Humans are trained in the same way.

## Induction and Science
Scientists make inferences from observations they have made to very general laws about nature's workings.

Newton's Law of Gravitation was derived from observation.

Scientists then use these laws to generate predictions.

Scientists appear to use inductive reasoning.

Scientists try to explain nature's workings in terms of nature'
s mechanisms. Scientists answer nature's whys and hows.

Harman's Approach:

Scientific reasoning is not inductive reasoning, which Harman calls *enumerative induction.* That is not the same as scientific induction.

The scientific induction used is better described as *inferences to the best explanation* (IBE). If we understand this kind of reasoning, we can avoid the problem of induction.

> One infers, from the fact that a certain hypothesis would explain the evidence to the truth of that hypothesis.

Harman is saying to look for hypotheses that explain the observations.

We conclude the hypothesis that provides the best explanation for the observations.

The hypothesis that is the best overall explanation of the observations should be chosen to be correct.

When is one hypothesis *better* than another as an explanation?

1. Plausability: how much sense does it make for this hypothesis to be the case? Is it likely or is it far-fetched?

2. Simplicity: Other things being equal, a simpler hypothesis is more explanatory than a more complicated one (Steelyard). Not *ad-hoc*. An ad-hoc hypothesis requires a bunch of adjustments and additional premises to make it possible.

For example, in the 18th century there was a theory that things burned because a substance was escaping from them and that was what you saw when you saw fire. The substance was known as Phlogiston. It was discovered that certain metals weighed more after rusting than before.

This was hard to reconcile with the idea that a substance was leaving the metal. The scientists said that it weighs more because phlogiston has negative weight. This clearly is wrong and is an example of an *ad-hoc* explanation.

Theories should not have these *ad-hoc* tweaks just to make them still work.

IBE's are everywhere.

There is a difference between Pavlov's association and the scientific best way of explaining observations.

We are using IBE rather than inductive inference to resolve the problem if induction, according to Harman. If we emphasize IBE, then the kind of reasoning when we reason through IBE are not inductive. Then we do not need to justify inductive reasoning if the kind of reasoning being undertaken is not inductive.

It is a solution to the problem of justifying inductive inference by way of avoidance. IBE is not induction, is is the drawing of logical conclusions when presented with particular observations. Not just if it happened before, it will happen again.

Scientific explanations are still general explanations. They go beyond what has been observed in nature. When scientists appeal to electrons, etc, they are operating with a general theory about how nature produces its effects.

If those theories really are general and apply to nature's workings always and everywhere, doesn't their generality depend on the assumption that nature doesn't change suddenly? Isn't this PUN?

The IBE's might be no more justified than inductive inferences because they depend on PUN, which cannot be proven.

Arguably, IBE rely on assumptions just as problematic as PUN. The steelyard assumes that nature operates on the simplest set of principles and IBE uses the steelyard. Why do we tend to the direction of simpler rather than more complicated explanations? It is difficult to prove why this is strictly better.

Is the preference for simplicity amount to more than a psychological fact? Is it just, like PUN was argued to be, a function of habit?
