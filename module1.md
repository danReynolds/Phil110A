## What is Philosophy?
What do we do when do philosophy?

1. Try to figure out what we should believe. What we should believe. What is it to believe something? It is to form a judgement about something. To believe a proposition is to judge that it is true. To ask what we believe, we ask *what we take to be true*.

2. One of the central tasks is to give reasons for why somethings are true and others false. We try to show that there are reasons for thinking certain things true and others false.

## Two senses of Reason
Why does a person believe something? (God exists, etc). There are two types of answers:

1. **Reason as Explanation:** if they believe in God, it could be explained because they were raised in a religious community and grew up with religion. Or that they came to believe in God after a traumatic experience.

2. **Reason as Justification:** not strictly concerned with how it was that they came to believe what they did. Concerned with justifications by contrast. Whether this person has the kinds of reasons that justify this belief. Justifying reasons are reasons that provide rational support to a belief. They don't explain why they might have this belief, rather they give a rational backup to the belief itself. 

Explanation based reasons are not the kinds of reasons that would tempt you to adopt this belief as well. By contrast, with a good justificatory reason, that reason if a good one is one that gives someone else the basis to also follow that belief.

A justifying reason is a reason that provides rational support for a belief and if it succeeds, it should be somewhat convincing to someone who can rationally evaluate beliefs.

### The Point:
Philosophers are centrally concerned with reasons that give *justification for a belief*. Not simply explanations of why people happen to believe something, but justification for those beliefs.

## What's so special about philosophy?
What do philosophers do that is different? Partial answer:

The *generality* of philosophical issues/views:

1. **A biographical question**: what kinds of physical activities make you happy?

2. **A psychological question:** How do different kinds of physical conditions and circumstances affect our mental health?

3. **A philosophical question:** How are minds and bodies related?

We can see that the philosophical question is much more general, asking about the relationship between the mind and body. Much more general than the biographical or psychological.

Most of our questions will have this level of generality. 

## Metaphysics
Branch of philosophy that deals with the nature and structure of reality.

It asks questions like what kind of things exists/do not, how are those that exist related.

Issues:

* **Is there a God?** If there is a God, we have to acknowledge the natural universe and the supernatural universe. It is very general.

* **Freedom and Determinism**: Does the causal structure of the world leave room for human free will?

* **Individuation and Identity**: What does it mean to persist as a single unique individual over time? We change a lot over time. What is it that sows us together that lets us say we are now the same person we were a year ago.

* **Mind and Body**: What's the relationship? Animals and lower level animals have both minds and bodies, what is the relationship between the two?

## Epistemology
Deals with questions of the nature of knowledge, the theory of knowledge. It is dealing with about questions about how we come to know certain things or anything at all.

It deals with issues about what it is to give good reasons about the beliefs that we hold. 

Issues:

* **The Problem of Skepticism:** Can we know anything at all? Or is everything dubious? How can we show that we really do know something?

* **Empiricism vs Rationalism:** Is our knowledge of the world fundamentally based on sensory experience? Empiricists say yes, rationalists say no.

* **The Problem of the External World:** Can we prove that an external world exists? Do we need proof? Can we say it does without being able to prove it does?

* **The Problem of Induction:** On what grounds can we justify our general knowledge given the limitations of our experience? (Scientific laws). If it holds for one, can we infer it holds for others?

# Philosophical Method
## Process of Argumentation
Deductive arguments and evaluating their efficacy. It is not the only type of argument to try and develop. It has distinctive logical concepts and is relevant to upcoming topics.

## God's Existence
There are many arguments aimed at showing God's existence and tend to be deductive arguments.

## What is an argument?
It is a series of statements, some of them called *premises*. Others are *conclusions.*

The arguer is trying to convince the listener of his or her conclusions.

Premises provide grounds in support of her conclusions.

## Deductive Arguments:
Arguments in which premises are intended to provide **logically conclusive grounds** for a conclusion. The premises don't convey a *maybe* of the conclusion, but through use of the premises and logical steps we reach the conclusion irrefutably.

ex.1

1. All humans are mortal. (premise)
2. Your lecturer is human. (premise)
3. Therefore your lecturer is mortal. (conclusion)

### Validity of the Argument
It would not be possible for the conclusion to be false if the premises were true. True implies true.

### Validity is not the only criterion
A valid argument is not necessarily a good one. The conclusion not only should logically follow from the premises, but you need to believe that the premises are true.

## **Soundness:**
To be sound, an argument has to satisfy two conditions:

1. The argument must be valid. If the premises are true, the conclusion cannot be false. True implies true.

2. The argument's premises must be true.

If confronted with a deductive argument, check its **soundness.**

## Arguments for God's Existence

1. Saint Thomas Aquinas: *Five Ways*: shows five deductive ways to prove the existence of God. These are versions of the *Cosmological Argument* which makes very general claims about the nature of the universe. Take a long view of the way processes in the cosmos are arranged and extrapolate a reason to conclude that there must be a god behind it all.

2. Saint Anselm: *Ontological Argument:* not a matter of extrapolating on how the cosmos is put together, but a strategy that we can be assured god exists because of the very idea of god.
