# Lesson 5
## Three Dialogues Between Hylas and Philonous
If you put one hand in cold water and another in hot water and then touch an object, the object will be both hot and cold. This is not possible, then the state of the object must be a matter of your own perception.

The qualities of hot and cold are just sensations in the mind, then extrapolate this to all qualities.

Size is a weak point. Moving forward and backwards is your perception of the object's size not a description of the actual size of the object. Colour and secondary qualities might be solely perception/general opinion based but size is definitely a quality of the object and not dependent on perception when you consider units of measurement.

A grain to a flea is perceived to be larger to the flea than to a person but this does not mean the grain is in two different states of size, rather it is perceived to have two different sizes. Perceived size and the quality of size are different things.

Size really is inherent in the object. Your perception of its size can change.

 Hylas says that qualities cannot be conceived to exist without a support, something spread under it, this is the material substratum. He only has a notion of the substratum in that it relates to the qualities as their support.

But Phil. shows that there is no relation between the material substratum and the qualities.

If the substratum is spread under/supporting the extension, must it not have an extension itself?

Then every substance being the substratum of extension must have extension and therefore another substratum, ad nauseum?

But Hyl argues that matter is not spread in a gross literal sense under extension. The word substratum is used only to express in general the same thing with substance.

Phil convinces him that since he thinks of all things in his own mind, that he cannot think of something not thought of in a mind.

If we can move closer or farther from an object, how can we possibly say there is one true actual object if we don't know which viewpoint of ours is correct? Is its size the size I see at 1m or 10m or 100m? (133)

Use Measurement! There is a **real** size.

At the start of (135) Phil talks about how how he doesn't get how motion in the nerves and the sensation of sound and colours in the mind. It could not make sense to any reasonable man.

If the brain makes ideas, and ideas are only in the mind, and the brain is an idea, how could the brain be made if it is the source of ideas?

Talk about his flawed understanding of the brain and the mind.

Phil concludes that there is a God because some mind must perceive all things since sensible things like a tree only exist if perceived by a mind and no mortal can perceive all things.

There must be a God out of necessity since things exist. 

> An infinite mind should be necessarily inferred from the bare existence of the sensible world.

We perceive things by our senses. Nothing is perceived by the senses but ideas and ideas exist only in the mind.
