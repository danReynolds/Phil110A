## Module 3
### The Ontological Argument
Saint Anselm:

> You are something (God) than which nothing greater can be thought.

It is one thing for an object to exist in the mind, and another thing to understand that an object actually exists.

When a painter plans to make something, he knows it exists in his mind but does not believe that it yet exists in reality.

That which nothing greater can be thought cannot solely exist in the mind because if it exists solely in the mind, it can be thought to exist in reality as well which is greater.

Therefore that which nothing greater can be thought must be thought to exist in reality or it is a contradiction.

This being is God. God cannot even be thought not to exist by this reasoning.

Whoever thinks of God in such a way cannot think of him as not existing.

### On Behalf of the Fool
Gaunilo recaps what Anselm has told us that:

> if that which nothing greater can be thought existed in the mind can be thought exists in the mind alone, anything that existed also in reality would be greater than this being, and thus that which is greater than everything would be less than some thing and this is a contradiction.

It is then necessary that that which nothing greater can be thought must be thought to exist in reality otherwise it is not the greatest thing that can be thought.

Here we may use the example of the island:

If anyone tells me about an island that is richer and better than all other islands, I shall easily understand it. But if we then try and follow that since it is more excellent to exist in reality than in the mind, this island which was already conceived to be the best island in the mind must exist in reality otherwise it is not more excellent than all others, since it is better for an island to exist in reality than strictly in the mind.

It must first be proved by argument that there is some higher nature, namely that which is greater and better than all the things that are, so that from this we are able to infer everything else which necessarily cannot be wanting to what is greater and better than everything.

### The Will to Believe
William James was a founder of the philosophical belief that has come to be known as pragmatism.

James says that a **live** hypothesis is any which appeals a real possibility to whom it is proposed. These are relations to the individual thinker. To a person in the West, the notion that the 53rd Hindu god exists is most likely a dead hypothesis. It is not considered to be a real possibility. But to a Hindu who has been surrounded by these notions their entire life, it is a live hypothesis.

The decision between two hypotheses is an **option**. Options may be living or dead and forced or avoidable and momentous or trivial. A genuine option is one that is living, forced and momentous.

A living option is one in which both hypotheses are live ones. A forced option is one where there is no third alternative. It is absolutely necessary to pick one hypothesis or the other.

A momentous option is life-changing. A physicist can pursue a living option for a time, but instead of confirming one hypothesis or the other, could abandon the endeavour after failing to get anywhere. A momentous option can never be explored again and must be of great importance.

Pascal tells us that we have nothing to lose by believing in God compared to an infinity to gain.

Clifford on the other hand notes that:

> It is wrong always, everywhere, and for every one, to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.

James goes on to say that:

> Our reason is quite satisfied in 999/1000 cases if it can find a few arguments that will do to recite in case our credulity is criticized by someone else. Our faith is faith in someone else's faith and in the greatest of matters this is most the case.

It is then not true that free will and simple wishing are superfluous. There are many things that we believe in that we cannot immediately explain how or why. We believe in many principles and theories without intellectual backing or any more clearly than a disbeliever.

It is often not insight but prestige that wins us over. Pure insight and logic, whatever they might do ideally, are not the only things that really do produce our creeds.

The thesis James presents is:

> Our passional nature not only lawfully may but must decide an option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds. For to not decide but leave the question open is a passional decision just like deciding yes or no and is attended with the same risk of losing the truth.

As intellectuals, we must

1. Know the truth
2. Avoid error

These are different. While through knowing A we escape the error of believing B, it hardly ever happens that by disbelieving B, we necessarily believe A.

By disbelieving B, we may believe C or D as easily as A. Or we may disbelieve B and believe none of them.

We may regard one as more important than the other. Believing truth could be the primary goal and avoiding error a secondary. Clifford would tell us to believe nothing, rather than by closing it on insufficient evidence believe lies.

The risk of being in error, however, may be very small when considered against the benefits of being correct. He who says it is better to go without belief than with a lie is just afraid of being wrong. It is like a general stating that it is better to stay out of battle than risk a single wound.

Our errors are not nearly that bad of a thing. This excessive nervousness is the real danger for an empiricist philosopher.

Wherever the option between losing truth and gaining it is not momentous, unlike the previous situation where we could have small errors for potential large gain, we should wait to save ourselves from potential falsehood.

This is nowhere more important than in believing theories of mathematics or physics, or in courts of law. It is better to wait for sufficient evidence to support one viewpoint than risk catastrophe by making an assumption.

You must strike a sceptical balance, since in math or physics if passionate people did not make leaps of faith or go off of hunches, we would have advanced much slower than we have.

> The most useful investigator, because the most sensitive observer, is always he whose eager interest in one side of the question is balanced by an equally keen nervousness lest he become deceived.

Wherever there is no forced option, the dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet hypothesis ought to be ideal.

**Moral questions**, however, are ones where this methodology cannot be applied. Waiting will often not yield a solution to these problems. 

The issue of whether a person likes a person is dependent on whether it is assumed one is liked or if it is assumed one is not. If one assumes one is liked than the person will act differently towards them and is more likely to be liked in return. If one assumes one is not liked, one might act coldly to another person and not be liked in return. *Faith in the fact can help create the fact.*

In truths dependent on personal action, faiths based on desire are not wrong as Clifford writes. But these are all small human matters, can it be wise to act on faith on cosmic issues?

### The Religious Hypothesis
1. The best things are the more eternal things.
2. We are better of to think that the first thing is true.

A person must ask herself whether this is a living option. It is certainly a momentous option and is a **forced** option since we cannot escape the issue by remaining sceptical. If we remain sceptical and agnostic we also lose the good, eternal life, just as much as if we were an atheist because we did not believe and will not be rewarded.

Many agnostics would say it is better to risk loss of truth than chance of error. But since this is a forced option, by not picking, it is the same as by will siding against religion. We therefore are potentially committing an error either way.

It would therefore be better to error on the side of believing and being wrong than not believing and being wrong.

Since we will likely never be given sufficient evidence, Clifford's writings should not apply to religious matters since James suggests that:

> A rule of thinking which would absolutely prevent me from acknowledging certain kinds of truths if those kinds of truths were really there, would be an irrational rule.

We should then believe any hypothesis that is live enough to tempt our will even without empirical evidence as Clifford suggested.

In conclusion, the freedom to believe can only cover living options which the intellect of the individual cannot by itself resolve.

> If we believe that no bell in us tolls to let us know for certain when truth is in our grasp, then it seems a piece of idle fantasticality to preach so solemnly our duty of waiting for the bell. But if we do so, we do so at our peril as much as if we believed. In either case we **act**, taking our life in our hands.

## Reflection on James's Writings
For James, a live option is simply one that appeals to a person as a real option.

But certain options that appeal to a person as real possibilities may in fact be impossible, while ones that do not appeal as real could very well be at least plausible.

Someone raised a Christian may believe Buddhism to be a dead option, but this shouldn't be a reason to exclude Buddhism as an option. There may be more historical evidence for Buddhism than Christianity.

A **live** option should instead be defined as an option that is not improbable in light of available evidence.

Assuming then that options are live, forced, momentous, and not capable of intellectual resolution, then all religions could become genuine options for a person. How is one to choose between them?

The religious hypothesis can be formulated as follows:

For any X and for any Y, if X is eternal and Y is not, X > Y.

The second statement is that it is better to believe this formulation than not.

Numbers are eternal, are they better than 1000 years of peace and love?

Redefining the formulation as follows:

For X,Y, if X is a perfect and eternal being and Y is not, X is better than Y.

Atheists could support the belief that it is better to believe an eternal being is more perfect than a non-eternal and non-perfect being. It does not follow from this admission that the being exists.

Assume that **there does** exist a perfect and eternal being. Using Pascal's wager, we would want to believe in God because of the benefits it would give us. Also, it may be true that theists tend to be happier. Even if God did not exist, assume that theists would still be happier given the way the world is structured.

This assumption is not necessarily the case. It has been reported to be more likely that, in fact, a non-theistic family selected at random will be healthier, and have better education than a randomly selected theistic family.

Perhaps theists can achieve a higher level of happiness than a non-theist can reach through religious tranquility and serenity. But perhaps these types of happinesses are no better than the sort of happiness that would result from a non-theist's satisfying job.

Additionally, this state of mind must be achievable without religious belief. Even if they could be happier, on average a non-theist is likely to be happier than the average theist by statistics.

Non-belief additionally puts responsibility for humanity's problems on humans. Self-reliance may go a long way to outvalue the happiness a belief in God may produce.

Choosing the correct religion becomes difficult following James's arguments. There would be no reason to pick one over the other.

Furthermore, James's God seems vindictive and ungenerous to skeptics. Why should going beyond what evidence indicates, by will of faith, be rewarded?

Finally, James does not entertain the scientific notion of disconfirmation. Suppose one believes in some god and yet no evidence of his existence is revealed. James does not entertain the possibility that this failure would count against the hypothesis that god exists.
