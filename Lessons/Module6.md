# Lesson 6
Moore's proof for the existence of two human hands:

> Here is one hand, and here is another.

This would not be a proof unless three conditions were satisfied:

1. unless the premises which were adduced as proof of the conclusion were different from the conclusion adduced to be proven.

2. unless the premise which was adduced was something that was known to be true.

3. unless the conclusion did really follow from the premises.

All three of these things were satisfied by his proof.

1. Obvious because the conclusion could be true even if the premise was not.

2. He knew that there was one hand in his possession as he held it up and similarly knew that there was another hand as he raised the other. He knew those to be true at the time that he did them.

3. It is quite certain that the conclusion follows from the premise. If these hands are known and observed to exist as demonstrated in the premise, then they certainly do.

This proof applies not only to hands but to everything.

I can know things that I cannot prove.

## The Problem of the Criterion (Chisolm)
It is the problem of the *diallelus*, the wheel, the vicious circle. 

To know whether things really are as they seem to be, we must have a procedure for distinguishing appearances that are true from appearances that are false.

But to know whether these procedures are good procedures, we must know whether it really succeeds in distinguishing good from bad appearances.

And we cannot know whether it really succeeds unless we already know which appearances are true and which are false. And so this becomes a paradoxical circle.

How are we to decide in any particular case whether we have genuine items of knowledge?

If there is a criterion of truth, a way to distinguish true knowledge from false, it must satisfy three conditions:

1. It should be *internal:* no reason or rule of truth that is provided by an external authority can serve as an ultimate criterion. For the mind cannot attain to certainty until it has found within itself a sufficient reason for adhering to the testimony of such an authority.

2. It should be *objective:* the ultimate reason for believing cannot be a merely subjective state of the thinking subject. The ultimate ground of certitude cannot consist in a subjective feeling. It can be found only in that which, objectively, produces this feeling and is adequate to reason.

3. The criterion must be *immediate*. To be sure, a certain conviction may rest upon many different reasons some of which are subordinate to others. But if we are to avoid an infinite regress, then we must find a ground that presupposes no other. There must be an immediate criterion of certitude.

We approach an infinite regression in trying to determine good from bad beliefs. First we want to find out which are good beliefs and which are bad ones. To find this out we need to use a method of determination. But which methods are good and which methods are bad? We need to use a method to determine which methods are good and which methods are bad. But then we need to make sure our method for determining which methods are good and bad is good, and you see this is never-ending.

The skeptic will say, if you use commons sense and apply a method to sort out the good and the bad ones because you can see that it puts the good ones on the right and bad on the left, then why did you need the method at all if you could just see the good and the bad.

There are two pairs of questions:

1. What do we know? What is the extent of our knowledge?
2. How are we to decide whether we know? What are the criteria of knowledge?

If we knew some good apples and some bad apples, we could figure out a way to determine good apples from bad apples. But without knowing, we cannot determine the method.

Alternatively, if you know the second question, and have good directions for telling whether apples are good or bad, then maybe you can find a good one, assuming that there are some good ones to be found.

But without a definite method, it is difficult to see how you could possibly figure out an answer to the first. 

The skeptic will say, to answer 1 you need 2 and to answer 2 you need 1. Therefore you cannot answer either.

Let *methodists* be those who have an answer to 2. Let *particularists* be those who have an answer to 1.

Locke for example is a methodist because he believes the method for deriving knowledge is through sensory experience.

The empiricist uses their methodology to determine the good and bad apples. The objection to the methodist approach is that the criterion seem arbitrary.

How can one begin with broad, generalizing criterion without particulars to use as proof? 

What reasons do they have for adopting one criterion over another? 

Another objection is that this approach often catches good apples as well. The empiricist only knows facts pertaining to sensation, when many other facts are also true but are thrown out because of this.

They cannot know whether objects have existed, only that they have sensed them to exist.

You can only know that sensations exist in the present because we cannot experience the past through the senses.

Out of skepticism, methodism and particularism, particularism seems the most logical. Suppose that there are some beliefs we know to be true, and use them to establish methods of determining other true beliefs.

Spinoza:

> In order to know, there is no need to know that we know, much less to know that we know that we know.

Just because our senses sometimes deceive us does not mean they are currently deceiving us.

St. Augustine said that it is more reasonable to trust the senses than to distrust them.

The senses should be regarded as innocent until there is some positive reason, on some particular occasion, for thinking that they are guilty on that particular occasion.

Therefore, in answer to the diallelus, start with particular cases of knowledge and then from those generalize and formulate criteria of goodness. Criteria telling us what it is for a belief to be epistemologically respectable.

The theory of evidence presupposes an objective right and wrong. An epistematic preferability is called an objective concept. If, objectively, one state of mind is preferred over another, then anyone in a different state, is mistaken in their preference.

A proposition is evident for a person if it is beyond reasonable doubt for that person and is such that his including it among the propositions upon which he bases his decisions is preferable to his not so including it.

A proposition is acceptable if withholding it is not preferable to believing it.

The belief that we will be alive in an hour is usually a presumption in the belief's favour. A presumption is favourable only if believing it is epistematically preferable to believing its negation.

5 + 7 = 12 is evident to me, and there is no proposition such that it would be even better, epistematically, to believe this other proposition instead.

Leibniz has said that there are two kinds of immediately evident proposition. The *first truths of fact* and the *first truths of reason*. 

An axiom, is a necessary proposition such that one cannot understand it without thereby knowing that it is true.

A proposition is axiomatic for a given subject if 

* the proposition is one that is necessarily true
* it is necessarily true that if the person then believes the proposition, the proposition is evident to him.

a proposition is *a priori* for a given subject if the proposition is axiomatic for the subject or if it is evident to the man at that time that the proposition is entailed by a set of propositions that are axiomatic.

The senses are to be treated as innocent until there is reason to suspect them guilty.

As *particularists,* in one's approach to the problem of the criterion, we will fit our rules to the cases. To the apples we know to be good and to the apples we know to be bad. 

We have at our disposal certain instances that our rules or principles should countenance (admit as acceptable), and others that our rules or principle should refute. As rational beings, we can investigate theses instances and formulate criteria that any instance must satisfy if it is to be countenanced or refuted.

In favour of this approach over the skeptic's is the fact that *we do know many things, after all*.

## On Certainty (Wittgenstein)
From it seeming to everyone to be so does not make it follow that it is so.

Saying *I know that* is an assurance that a person cannot be making a mistake, but it needs to be objectively established that a person is not making a mistake about that.

My believing a man who says he knows he has two hands is not the same as a man who says he knows that there are no external objects. For you can check your hands and ascertain that you do in fact have them, but you cannot do so with disqualifying the existence of all external objects.

*A is a physical object* is an instruction we give only to someone who doesn't yet understand either what A means or what a physical object means. That is why there is no proposition as: "There are physical objects." It is common sense!
