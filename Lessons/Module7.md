# Lesson 7
## An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding (Hume)
All reasonings concerning matter of fact are founded on the relation of cause and effect.

This is based on our experience.

But continuing our inquisition, what is the foundation of all conclusions from experience?

Why a past experience should be extended to future times and other objects is a difficult question.

> I have found that such an object has always been attended with such an effect, and I foresee, that other objects, which are, in appearance, similar, will be attended with similar effects.

We have said that all arguments concerning existence are founded on the relation of cause and effect. That our knowledge of that relation is derived entirely from experience and that all our experimental conclusions proceed upon the supposition that the future will be conformable to the past. 

To prove this would be going in a circle. 

In reality, all arguments from experience are founded on the similarity which we discover among natural objects and by which we are induced to expect effects similar to those which we have found to follow from such objects. 

From causes which appear similar, we expect similar effects. This is the sum of all our experimental conclusions.

How can we conclude that because of the colour and consistency of bread we are able to get the secret power that is its nutrients and sustenance?

There must be no connection, otherwise we would not need experience to deem this true, we could just observe the connection.

When a new object, with similar qualities and powers is produced, we expect similar powers and forces, and look for a like effect.

All inferences from experimentation suppose as their foundation that the future will resemble the past, and that similar powers will be conjoined with similar qualities. If the course of nature changes and the past is not a rule for the future, then all experience is useless.

Since occassionally things change and past experience becomes invalidated/obsolete, why can we say that it will not in any particular case?

What logic secures you against the fact that it could change?

Hume concludes that it is not reasoning that has us suppose that the past will resemble the future, as he can find no reason for it, rather it is a fact from experience.

If he is right, he says that he has not made any major discovery.

If he is wrong, then he has overlooked an argument which has been perfectly familiar to him since he was a baby, as even they know to learn cause and effect.

## The Inference of the Best Explanation (Harman)
Enumerative induction is not a warranted form of inference in its own right, and when it seems like it works, it is because it is a special case of another sort of inference, namely the *inference of the best explanation* (IBE).

Either enumerative induction is wrong, or it is just IBE.

IBE corresponds to what others call *abduction* or *the method of hypothesis* or even *the method of elimination*.

In general, there will be many hypotheses which might explain the evidence, so one must be able to reject all such alternative hypotheses before one is warranted in making the inference. 

One infers that a given hypothesis would provide a better explanation for the evidence than would any other, so the conclusion of this best hypothesis must be true.

We judge which is better by determining the simplest solution, which is the least *ad-hoc* (overcomplicated, hand-wavy).

Enumerative induction as a separate form of nondeductive inference is superfluous and can be replaced with IBE.

When we use the classic induction step that if one A is a B, the next A will be a B, we can similarly use IBE and weigh the hypotheses that the next A will be a B versus the next A not being a B.

We can then justify things attempted to be proven using enumerative induction using the evident application of the inference of the best explanation.

If a person is to *know*, his belief must be both true (actually the case) and warranted (the person believes what is true). **Knowledge is conditional on the lemmas being true.**

You can believe that your friend works for a company, but they could have been lying. Your belief that they worked for the company was warranted because you trusted your friend, but not true since they lied and are not actually working for the company.

When an expert tells us something, we are often warranted to believe them. 

If we are to account properly for our use of the word *know*, we must remember that these inferences are instances of the inference to the best explanation.

Enumerative induction can err, if we take someone's writings as knowledge, we may be wrong because while it is warranted to trust them, they may have mistyped and taught us something false.

This is not knowledge because the lemma that they did not err is not true, but enumerative induction would have led us to believe this was knowledge even though the lemmas were not satisfied.

We must use intermediate lemmas, such as the proposition that the writing is there because it was written correctly. This lemma plays a critical role in the inference we conclude.

Using enumerative inference, this lemma would have played no role.

If someone moves their hand back because it becomes burned, we must have the lemma such as the proposition that the pain is why the hand is withdrawn and that the hand is withdrawn because of the mental experience of the person. Without this lemma, it is not knowledge to withdraw your own hand.

Enumerative induction is not real knowledge, it would have just told us that touching a stove should cause a hand to be withdrawn and we will do so going into the future, even if the stove is cold. If our own mental experience shows us that the stove is cold, don't withdraw our hand, our doing so was conditional on the lemma that they experienced pain and that is why they withdrew the hand.

Enumerative induction would eliminate the lemmas that justify, through inference of the best explanation, how we know certain things.

Don't do things because we see other people do them, do things because we see other people do them and we understand why they do them. The best explanation for why they did A is B, and because we understand this, we also do A.

Don't trust a book because it was written by someone trustworthy, trust it because you have no reason to believe what they have written is false. But if it looks like it is, don't believe it, they could have erred.

We can best account for certain necessary conditions of one having knowledge if we explain these conditions in terms of the condition that the lemmas be true and if we think of the inference on which knowledge is based as the inference to the best explanation rather than as enumerative induction.
