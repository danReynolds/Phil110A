## Aquinas' Five Ways:

1. First and most obvious is based on change. Anything changed is being changed by something else. What is causing the change cannot be the thing that is changing itself. 

This means that something causes something else and is in turn caused by something else itself. This can't go on forever, since then there would be no first cause of the chain and as a result no following causes. A first must exist to cause a second.

So we are forced to come to the conclusion that there must have been a first cause of change not itself changed by anything, and this is what is called God.

2. Second way is based on the notion of **agent cause**. Eliminating a cause eliminates its effects. A series of causes can not go on forever, since then it will have no first cause, and if it has no first cause, it cannot have an intermediate and subsequent last cause, which is false since the sequence is not empty.

We are then forced to concede some first agent cause which is given the name God.

3. The third way is based on what need not be and on what must be. Some things are contingent (need not be) since we find them being created or destroyed at whim. Everything cannot be like this, otherwise once there was nothing.

Since something cannot come from nothing, there would still be nothing today if there was once nothing, so something must have been necessary.

A series of necessary things can depend on other necessary things, but just as we proved that a series of agent causes must have a first, so must the necessary things.

Then there was a first necessary thing, owing to nothing that is the cause allowing other things to be.

4. The fourth way is based on the levels found in things. Some things are better, truer and more excellent than others. Fire for example causes all other things to be hot. There is something that must be most good then, from which all other goodness originates. This is what we call God.

5. This last way is based on the guidedness of nature. Goal-directed behaviour is exhibited in all beings, even those not aware. But nothing lacking awareness can tend to a goal unless it is directed by someone with awareness and understanding, such as arrows by archers.

Therefore everything in nature is directed to its goal by someone with understanding. This person we call God.

## The Simpler Version:
the **Cosmological Argument** is this: Everything we know has a cause. But there cannot be an infinite regression of causes, therefore there was a first cause, namely God.

## Objections:
Even if there is a first cause, this first cause does not have to be God. A first cause does not have to have the properties associated with God, such as infinite knowledge or goodness.

Additionally, experience does not show anything that does not have a cause and is itself a first cause. The assumption that there is a first cause seems to be empirically unsupported. There are infinite sequences in numbers, why not in causality?

## Analysis of Way 2:
An agent cause need not be temporal, a cause is only required to be prior to its effects in that the cause can exist without the effect but not conversely.

Consider a chain, links do not support the next temporally. The first cause, even if established, need not be God, and Aquinas gives no non-question-begging reason why there could not be an infinite regression of causes.

> Unless some relevant difference is shown between a temporal and non-temporal infinite series, then Aquinas's claim that an infinite temporal sequence cannot be shown to be impossible seems to cast doubt on his claim that the impossibility of a nontemporal causal series can be shown.

## Analysis of Way 3:

Proof of God by Way 3:

1. Each existing thing is capable of not existing. (premise 1)
2. What is true for each thing is true for everything. (premise 2)
3. Therefore everything could cease to exist. (premise 3)
4. If everything could cease to exist, then it already has. (premise 4)
5. Therefore everything has ceased to exist.
6. If everything has ceased to exist and there can be nothing brought into existence by nothing, then nothing exists now.
7. There could not be something brought into existence by nothing.
8. Therefore, nothing exists now.
9. Something does exist now.
10. By 8 and 9, or premise 1 is false.
11. Therefore there must be something that must exist.
12. Every necessary being must have cause of its necessity either within or outside itself.
13. There cannot be an infinite series of necessary beings that have a cause of their necessity outside themselves.
14. Therefore there is a necessary being that does not have a cause outside itself and that is the cause of the necessity of other beings.
15. Therefore, God exists.

14 to 15 does not arguably follow since this being might not be God. premise 2 seems to commit the fallacy of composition. Just because each thing is capable of not existing does not mean they all did not exist together.

Additionally, premise 4 seems illogical, just because something can not exist doesn't mean it has not existed.

If these premises are not true, then the proof is unsound.
