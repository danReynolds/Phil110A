# Lesson 4
## An Essay Concerning Human Understanding
1. Anything in nature that we perceive can be thought of as an idea. It becomes a positive idea in the understanding of the mind, even if it is only a privation of the subject.

2. 
The ideas of heat and cold, dark and light, white and black, motion and rest, are equally clear and positive ideas in the mind, though perhaps some of the causes which produce them are barely privations in those subjects whence our senses derive those ideas. 

It is one thing to perceive and know the idea of white and black. It is another to examine what kind of particles are arranged so that it can be these colours.

3. Anyone has the idea of white and black, and while these positive ideas are understood in the mind, the colour in the external object is a privation.

4. Privations may produce positive ideas.

5. The shadow of a man does not actually represent the man. An image would be bare a more accurate resemblance.

6. It will be difficult to determine whether there are really any ideas from a privative cause until it is determined whether rest can be any more a privation than motion.

7. Ideas and perceptions in the mind are not exactly the images and resemblances of something inherent in the subject.

8. A snowball having the power to produce in us the ideas of white, cold, and round are called qualities. These qualities will be referred to as ideas as well.

9. Take a grain of wheat, divide it into parts, each part still has solidity, extension, figure, and mobility. Divide it again and it retains still the same qualities. Division can never take away these qualities. These are called original, primary qualities of body. 

10. Qualities which in truth are nothing in the objects themselves but powers to produce various sensations in us by their primary qualities, by the figure, motion, bulk, etc, are called secondary qualities and include colours, sounds, tastes.

11. Bodies produce ideas in us by impulse.

12. Our senses interpret real objects and create a resemblance of these objects as ideas in our minds.

13. Secondary qualities are also observed by our senses, a piece of steel sliding through our flesh does not inherently have any reason to resemble pain but it is by our senses' interpretation of this event that we get the pain relationship.

14. These sensations are nothing in the objects themselves but the powers to produce these various sensations in us and depend on the primary qualities of the objects from which resemblances can be drawn.

15. Therefore the ideas of primary qualities are resemblances of the actual objects and the relationship does really exist. But the ideas in us produced by secondary qualities have no resemblance to the actual objects at all.

16. Flame is hot and light, but at one distance it burns and another it warms. The idea of warmth is not actually in the fire, rather this is a secondary quality created by our sensory perceptions.

17. The bulk, number, figure, and motion of the parts of fire or snow are really in them and therefore may be called real qualities. Take away the sensation of heat, whiteness, coldness from the senses and they are not really a part of the object. They vanish altogether.

18. Manna can produce a sensation of sickness. These ideas of sickness and pain are not in the manna, rather they are effects of its operations on us. They are nowhere when we immediately ingest the manna, before it kicks in. Its sweetness is similarly just an effect of the operations of the manna on several parts of our bodies by the size, figure, number and motion of its parts. 

19. Consider red and white colours in the stone porphyry. If you do not allow light to hit it, its colours vanish. It no longer produces any such ideas in us. Upon the return of the light it produces these appearances again. Since it has no colour in the dark, this quality is not innately a part of the object. It is only a sensation produced in us by the reflection of light. Is something red if it is in the dark, if we know from its physical composition that in the light it would be red because of the light rays it reflects? I'd say yes.

20. Pound an almond and the clear colour will be altered to a brown one. The change in texture, a primary quality, induces a change in colour, a secondary quality.

21. Ideas being thus distinguished and understood, we know that the same water can produce cold on one hand and hot on the other but a square is never perceived physically by one hand to be a circle by the other. Here we further draw the line.

22. The real primary qualities when combined produce the secondary imputed qualities.

23. The qualities in bodies are of three types:
1. The bulk, figure, number, situation and motion or rest of their solid parts. Those are in them, whether we perceive them or no. These are primary qualities.
2. The power that is in any body by reason of its insensible primary qualities to operate after a peculiar manner on any of the sens, and thereby produce different ideas of several colours, sounds, smells, tastes, etc, are called secondary qualities.
3. The power that is in any body by reason of the particular constitution of its primary qualities to make a change in an object's primary qualities are called powers.

24. Light from the sun is just a power in it, not a real quality.

25. While we receive the idea of heat and light from the sun, its ability to change a person's skin tone is not a quality resembled in the sun, since this colour does not occur in the sun. Rather it acted as a power to change their skin tone. It is not a communication of any quality which was really in the sun. We are apt to believe that our ideas are resemblances of something in the object, but that is not so, it is merely the work of our senses interacting with the actual qualities of the object.

26. All qualities other than bulk, figure, extension, number, and motion are not qualities of an object but powers in them depending on primary qualities. Our bodies interpret these secondary qualities and create ideas in us of them but they do not resemble any aspect of the actual object.

## Meditation on First Philosophy
Do not believe in anything unless there is no doubt of its falsehood. Attack the principles upon which opinions stand, as there are too many opinions to attack them individually.

It is wiser not to trust something that has ever deceived us. We are deceived by our dreams and can interpret them as real.

Arithmetic and geometry can be relied upon more than Physics and Medicine because medicine can deceive you, but whether you are awake or asleep, `2 + 3 = 5`.

If God deceived me and made me err in my calculations, as humans do, then he would not be supremely good.

If you can doubt something to some degree, it should be considered as false as anything in order to be safe.

Consider everything false and then try to determine what is true.

Some evil genius has allowed me to be deceived at times, since God would not do this to me.

I will consider nothing true and then see what I can deduce, therefore giving support to nothing that could possibly be false.

Find something certain to exist. Set aside all things with some doubt and look for something certain.

If I fail then I at least will know for certain that there is nothing in the world we can know for certain.

If Archimedes only needed one point that was immovable to determine if the world was moving, then I just need one fact I know to be true to derive many others.

I must exist since I am considering that I do not exist.

Even if someone is deceiving me, he can never cause me to be nothing as long as I think that I am something.

Anytime I think that *I am, I exist*, it must be true. I am certain I exist, but what am I?

I cannot say I am a man because what is a man? This lends itself to many difficult issues. No aspects of the body can be sure to exist and not be a fabrication of some evil genius.

Thought is mine. It belongs to me. I am, I exist, I am a thing which really exists, but what thing? I am a thing which thinks.

All things that relate to the body are dreams.

I am a thing which thinks and a thing which thinks is a thing which doubts, understands, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, imagines and feels.

I have my mind, that is certain, but since I have believed everything else such as my body for so long, let us take a moment to consider all that has been discussed.

My observations of things, my sensing of touch and feel and all of my perceptions may only be real so much as they are real in my mind and therefore my mind is capable of having these thoughts reside inside me.

Even if I think `2 + 3 = 5`, it is possible a God made me so wrong that I believed `2 + 4 = 5`. I cannot affirm even that mathematics is true. 

While it is possible a deceiver has fooled me into believing wrong things like these, often I am so certain of them that I break out and say:

> Let who will deceive me, He can never cause me to be nothing while I think that I am, or some day cause it to be true to say that I have never been, it being true now to say that I am, or that two and three make more or less than five, or any such thing in which I see a manifest contradiction.

^^ the above is Descartes getting all flustered and noble. He believes his mind is sound and that no being can make him think bad math, or anything plainly wrong. He is saying that he trusts his mind.

I must next confirm two things to know whether anything beyond my own existence is true:

1. Is there a God who would be capable of deceiving me
2. Could this God be a deceiver

Without knowledge of these two truths, it is impossible to conclude anything else. I will look into these.
