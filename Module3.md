## Anselm's Ontological Argument for God's Existence
*Ontology* is a philosophical term referring to a subsection of metaphysics dealing with questions of existence. Questions related to the determination of what does and does not exist is under the branch of ontology.

Anselm suggests that there is a special connection between the idea of God and the idea of existence. It tries to establish the existence of God on the idea of God.

He defines God as:

> That than which nothing greater can be thought.

God is the idea of a being with no superior. It is impossible to imagine a being greater than God.

There are two ways God may be said to exist:

1. God can exist only in our minds as a mere idea. In this sense it only means that we have an idea of God.

2. The second sense of existing is the physical sense. Anselm wants to show that God exists in reality as well.

Anselm shows that the assumption that God only exists in our minds leads to a contradiction. Thus proving that God must exist.

### The outline of the argument:
1. You can tell that TWNGT exists in our minds because we can have a conception of such an entity as God. (premise 1)

2. TWNGT cannot exist only in our mind. (premise 2)

3. Therefore, TWNGT must exist in reality as well.

Anselm uses a sub-argument to prove premise 2. He assumes that TWNGT exists only in the mind and attempts to reach a contradiction:

1. If TWNGT exists in the mind, it can be *thought* to exist in reality as well, which is greater.
Now it has a foothold in reality once it has been thought to exist in the real world.

2. Therefore if TWNGT existed only in the mind, we could think of something greater, since from premise 1 if we can think of it in reality it would be made greater.

3. However, by definition, TWNGT is that than which **nothing** greater can be thought. By contradiction, if TWGNT existed only in the mind, there could be something greater, something that could be thought to exist in the real-world.

4. Therefore, the supposition that TWNGT exists only in the mind is contradictory.

5. Therefore, TWNGT can not exist only in the mind.

### Gaunilo's Criticism of the Ontological Argument
Gaunilo makes an argument from analogy. He tries to use similar reasoning as Anselm uses to show that this leads to a doubtful conclusion.

Using Anselm's argument in the same way in a different scenario leads to something illogical. Therefore Anselm's logic does not hold.

Gaunilo's argument is centered around a *Lost Island*, an island superior everywhere in abundance of riches to any other land.

1. The lost island exists in our minds. (premise 1)
2. The lost island cannot exist only in our minds. Since it is greater to exist in reality than in the mind alone and the island is the greatest of all islands. (premise 2).
3. Therefore, the lost island must exist in reality.

We can use this analogy with anything to bring creation to impossible things like *greatest* islands. Anselm's reasoning can not possibly be correct.

## Going over this Debate:
What is meant by **great?** Part of what makes God is God's ultimate knowledge and power.

God is great because God is always ethically correct, knowing the difference between right and wrong in every instance.

God is great because of God's:

1. Knowledge
2. Power
3. Moral goodness

In response to Gaunilo, Anselm said that this proof cannot be applied to anything but the existence of God. We cannot use this proof for islands or other analogies but only for the ultimate question.

For example, Anselm says that if we are trying to look at the greatest conceivable murderer, we cannot say the murderer is greater in the real-world since it is not morally better or greater for them to exist in the real-world so we cannot use the same argument.

No other subject but God can use the step of existing greater in reality other than God by the definition of greater.

For a second example, a perfect baseball pitcher would not be greater to exist in reality than in idea alone. The greatest conceivable pitcher existing in reality would ruin baseball because the competitive aspect of a baseball game would be completely undermined by his existence.

The greatest pitcher should only exist in the mind as well as their actual existence would be a disaster.

### What of the Island?
It is not obvious that the reasoning that works to show the existence of God can work for any object as Gaunilo suggests. It is worth considering Anselm's point that the reasoning can not be expected to work for anything but the existence of God.

There is still possibly any number of defects with Anselm's argument even if Gaunilo's response is fallible.

## Faith and Reason
 Does religious belief require proof in order to be rational?

William James believes that religious belief does not require intellectual ground to be rational. James's primary question is:

> Can there be any justification for religious belief if the evidence is insufficient to establish its truth?

Can faith be justified? Many religious traditions call on believers to accept their doctrine on faith alone.

There are two possible answers to this question:

1. No. There is a famous quotation by Clifford who says that:

> It is wrong always and everywhere for anyone to believe anything upon insufficient evidence.

It is reckless and dangerous to believe things without sufficient evidence.

2. This is not James's answer. He does not think that it is **always** wrong. He answers Yes. Belief can *sometimes* be justified as rational even without sufficient evidence to determine the truth of the belief.

Is not having enough evidence the same as not having reasons for your belief? Is this not then an irrational belief? There are other ways and means of being reasonable even when you do lack evidence for a belief.

### Pragmatic Justifications
These justifications concern practical benefits rather than evidential reasons or rational proof.

It points out that there are practical benefits to believing something, even if there aren't rational facts to back this pragmatic justification.

### Pascal's Wager:
God either exists or does not. Rather than try and create deductive proofs, Pascal explores how you would bet on God's existence.

What would the practical outcomes of this bet be?

You only need to look at the practical outcomes to see that betting on God is better than betting against God.

Assuming that you bet that God **does** exist:

* **Winning the Bet**: if you are correct, you are rewarded with eternal life in heaven and this is an infinite gain.

* **Losing the Bet**: if you lose the best, all you have really lost is the time spent at Church and the time spent in devotion to God. This is a relatively minor loss.

Then winning gives infinite gain and losing gives minimal loss.

Assuming that you bet that God **does not** exist:

* **Winning the Bet**: You don't really gain that much, you get the time you would have lost in religious devotion but this is a finite gain.

* **Losing the Bet**: If you lose you lose eternal life in heaven and this is an enormous loss.

Based on this pragmatic justification it becomes clear that it is smarter to wager that God does exist. You have infinitely more to gain and infinitely less to lose. Pascal suggests that we should bet on God.

## Why do People Not Bet on God?
James believes that most of the unbelievers will not be persuaded by this reasoning and those who do believe do not need this wager.

Not all people are going to be moved by the pragmatic justifications suggested by Pascal.

James invents the **Genuine Option**:

A genuine option has three components:

1. **Living Options:** they have to be real possibilities for the person considering them to be actual possibilities. People in one religion would have a very hard time believing as a genuine possibility that another religion's deity exist.

It cannot be a crazy option. Those who do not believe in religion cannot consider God to exist as a genuine option. The wager is useless because they know the first option, God's existence, is false and cannot get past that fact.

2. **Forced Options**: They must be the only options, there is no third.

3. **Momentous Options**: It cannot be a small decision, the choice must be a unique opportunity with significantly high stakes.

Together these components make up a **Genuine Option**.

James's Genuine Option is that you either support religious belief or forgo it. James's central thesis is:

> Our passional nature not only lawfully may, but must, decide an option between propositions, whenever it is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds.

It is our will rather than our assessment of evidence, our passional or willing nature, that will determine what we believe.

James construes faith as requiring an act of will, what we want, rather than logic. Our will is activated in the context of genuine options. It also must be a genuine option that cannot be decided on intellectual grounds. Our will is a repository of faith.

We cannot just believe as our will wants it in any genuine option. Only ones that are indeterminate on the basis of intellectual grounds like the existence of God. This blocks the irrational justification of things that could be rationally justified.

In one of these scenarios we are then forced to make our decision on our willing nature rather than our intellect. If we lack the intellectual grounds to back up a belief, it **must** be an act of will.

We must make a decision and must make a leap of faith.

## The Religious Hypothesis
1. The best things are the more eternal things.
2. We are better off even now if we accept the first.

James is not trying to pidgeonhole the discussion to a particular religious view. Rather he is speaking in more general terms, and is acknowledging that the best things are the more eternal, a dimension of reality that is more eternal.

He says we are better off even now if we accept this. James says it would be reasonable to accept this hypothesis even though we don't have reasons to support its truth.

This hypothesis is a live hypothesis and a genuine option because there are people who have not decided either way. If for *you* it is a live hypothesis, then you are faced with a genuine option:

*It is either best to accept the hypothesis or live without it.*

Assumption: you are unable to decide between the options on intellectual grounds.

James wants to say that this act of will is only possible if you lack evidence to either side. Then you are able to exercise your will.

If you really cannot use evidence as your guide, then any choice you make with respect to the Religious Hypothesis is an act of will. It is an act of faith.

The choice to accept or reject the hypothesis is really on the same side. If you accept or reject it, you are committing an act of faith. You don't have evidence that tells you either way but you are just executing an act of will.

For an agnostic or atheist, if they do so without rational argument or empirical evidence, they are committing an act of faith as much as someone who affirms the existence of God.

James want to say that if you don't have sufficient evidence for a decision, you don't have to decide against the hypothesis. He is saying that just because we cannot affirm the existence of God does not mean it is more reasonable to deny the existence of God, because we cannot affirm that either. Either way you are making the same sort of leap of faith. The same act of will.

In some circumstances, believing something can actually cause it to come true. For example, if we are nice to someone and believe that they like us, we are likely to act in ways that results in their liking of us.

Another example would be a mountain climber stuck on a ledge who must jump to another ledge. They can either believe they can make it or not. Someone who believes they can make it is more likely to succeed.

Maybe the religious hypothesis can work in the same way. Our ability to reap the benefits of the belief, even in the absence of evidence, may require us to believe first.

Someone who insists on intellectual grounds for belief might cut himself off from the opportunity to make God's acquaintance.

It would be rash to cut off the possibility of God's existence because of a lack of intellectual support.

Michael Martin suggest that the religious hypothesis as James formulates, even if accepted, does not point us in the direction of a religion or strong religious belief. He raises the question of which religion should we decide in? Since the hypothesis does not narrow it down.

Martin invites us to consider the evidence for the religious hypothesis and that it is irresponsible to say there is none if there might be. To accept or reject the religious hypothesis is not as neutral as James might want us to believe.

There are intellectual grounds for deciding, such as the lifestyles and success of those who as a will of faith support religion versus those who do not.
