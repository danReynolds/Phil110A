# Module 4
## Epistemology and Empiricism
*Epistemology* is the theory of knowledge and justification. It is the theory of how we go about justifying our beliefs.

*Empiricism* is the view that all of our knowledge is derived from experience. The human mind begins as a *Tabula Rasa*, a blank slate, from which it must be filled up.

Experience, rather than innate ability, is the source of all our knowledge. We learn about the world around us through sensory experience.

Opposition comes in the form of mathematical models that can not be experienced but can only be theorized. Some of the complicated/problematic details of Empiricism were addressed by **John Locke**. Wrote *An Essay Concerning Human Understanding*.

## What does the world contain?
1. The world consists of material objects.
2. It contains the qualities (sizes, shapes, colours, textures, odours, etc.) that the objects possess.

How can we know the qualities of objects? The senses are the endpoints that provide us the representations of the qualities that the objects possess.

When we see something red, our inner representation of red is invoked by the senses.

Our inner representations of outer objects are called *Ideas of Sensation* by Locke. These are the inner ideas invoked by our senses.

The consequence is that our awareness of objects is always *indirect*. Our knowledge of these objects is a matter of forming an inner representation of the object and its qualities. There is always a mediated representation of objects/qualities that arrive through sensory processes.

We only have access to these inner representations based on sensory input. Then how is it that our ideas of sensation convey information about outer objects?

Locke's answer to this question has two kinds of relation that go together to justify why these inner ideas convey information about outer objects/qualities.

1. Ideas of sensation are caused by outer objects. The ideas are causal messages that are sent by the objects themselves.
2. For Locke, at least some of our ideas of sensation are actually likenesses of the qualities that objects possess. There is a resemblance between our ideas of objects and how they actually are.

A photograph, for example, has a causal relationship to the object pictured, and the photograph resembles the object pictured. We pick up information from the picture, and it is useful, but it is of course not the object itself and is not nearly as accurate. This is similar to sensory ideas.

For Locke, it is only some of our sensory ideas that have this relationship. 

Locke has **Primary Qualities** of an object:
* The solidity, figure/shape, size, texture and motion of an object. All of these qualities are primary qualities. These are called primary qualities because they are real qualities that reflect a genuine, real feature of an object.

Our ideas of primary qualities are the ones that actually resemble the qualities themselves. Pictures of shape, size, etc. are resemblances of the actual qualities of objects. We can gain true information about these qualities.

The qualities are real features and the sensory ideas actually resemble the real features.

The ideas that do not bare the resemblance relationship are listed in the **Secondary Qualities:**

* Colours, smells, tastes, sounds, certain *feels* such as heat and cold. These qualities are only genuine features of objects in a limited sense. These qualities are *mere powers* to produce sensory ideas in us.

The smell or colour of a thing are just causal powers that produce sensory ideas in us. The inner representations of these qualities don't really resemble the qualities themselves.

While there is some causal relationship, the resemblance relationship does not hold. The idea that you have does not bare a resemblance to anything in the object that caused it.

You cannot take a smell and say there is some feature of an object that resembles this smell. When we see a red soccer ball, there is no feature of a red soccer ball that bares an objective resemblance.

Locke treats the secondary qualities this way because there are all kinds of sensations that we ordinarily consider as not baring any relationship to an object.

There was a medical substance in Locke's day that was ingested in order to make them vomit. The point of this was to cleanse the system. The ingestion would cause the sensation of nausea. No-one believes that the sensation of nausea bares an objective feature to the drug applied. There is no nausea in the substance, only a causal power that is capable of producing nausea in us, but the object is not inherently containing nausea.

Another example is the pain sensation experienced when we put our hands to close to a fire. There is nothing objective in the fire that bares any resemblance to the pain sensation. It is caused by the fire and how it seems to a person does not bare any objective resemblance to any feature of the fire itself.

Colours, smells, heat and cold are all examples of things that do not resemble anything in their objects themselves.

### Justification
Locke justifies this distinction thoroughly:

1. Locke says that primary qualities of an object *persist through physical division*. Dividing the physical objects into parts are always persisted. A grain of wheat when divided is still solid and has a definite size and a definite shape. These are primary qualities. The qualities are retained. But for a green leaf, when we divide it, it has a varying colour when you look at its parts under a microscope. Colour then is not a quality retained under all of its parts.

2. A second kind of argument Locke makes is that *perceived changes* of secondary qualities are dependent on changes in *primary qualities*. This makes primary qualities real object features of the object and secondary qualities are byproducts of primary qualities.

> Pound an almond and the clear white colour is altered into a dirty one. The sweet taste into an oily one. What real alteration can the beating of a pestle make in any body, but an alteration of the texture of it?

When you introduce changes into the primary qualities, such as mashing an almond, you change its texture but consequently its taste and colour. By changing the primary texture, you change the secondary taste and colour.

3. Ideas of secondary qualities are subjective byproducts of physical processes. Heat is a feature of a person's idea of a physical process, but it is an idea that has no objective correlation in the fire itself. Intensify the heat and it becomes a pain. The sensation of pain has no objective correlation, it does not resemble anything in the fire itself but is a subjective byproduct.

> Let not the eyes see light or colours, or the ears hear sounds; let the palate not taste, nor the nose smell, and all colours, tastes, odours, and sounds, as they are particular ideas, vanish and cease and are reduced to their causes. Size, figure, and motion of parts.

All of these ideas have nothing in the objects themselves that resemble them. The primary qualities cause them.

Sensory ideas of colour, taste, odour, etc have a causal basis in the object based on the primary qualities that the object exhibits.

## Mechanism
All physical interaction is *mechanical* in nature.

The causal interactions involve motion and collision among the parts of the matter. What we now know as molecules and atoms.

Only the primary qualities, shape, motion, etc are the qualities that have any baring on the physical processes that objects enter in to.

Sensory perception itself is largely a mechanical interaction between perceivers and objects.

When we touch things, there is a mechanical causal relationship. This is also true with visual observation, and other primary qualities. These mechanical interactions convey information about their causes such as the shape, motion, size of the object itself.

The idea of secondary qualities are a kind of side-effect that do not have an objective correlate and do not reflect an objective resemblance to any feature of the object itself. They change and are subjective to the primary qualities.

Nothing in an object says it should be the colour it is

## Appearance and Reality
Locke's Empiricism assumes that sensory experience is a trustworthy basis for knowledge. Is that assumption justifiable?

Some of our sensory ideas bear no resemblance to qualities in physical objects. Our ideas of primary qualities are supposed to convey important information resembling the objects themselves.

But how can we tell that the info we get actually bares a resemblance to the object since we don't have direct access? Our internal representation is supposed to be our conduit for gaining information about the actual object.

Without independent access to the object itself, how can we be sure that the resemblance is accurate? We could only know if the resemblance was accurate if we had the actual object to compare our resemblance to. But we don't since we can only access the object indirectly through our sensory ideas.

This is a serious problem for epistemologists.

## The Challenge of Skepticism
Rene Descartes has a series of **Meditations**. His most famous work is called the *Meditations on First Philosophy.* The world was undergoing great change as it transitioned from the medieval to the modern world through the Scientific Revolution.

Descartes First Meditation: **The Method of Doubt**:

Descartes had become dissatisfied with his state of knowledge. Many things he had been taught he thought was false. 

There was work being done on changing an old belief system into a new more modern belief system. His project was weeding out the old, wrong issues in way for the new, sound beliefs.

Descartes only wants to accept beliefs that are not open to doubt. He aims to do this by doubting everything and making a fresh start. He cannot assume anything he has learnt is unquestionably believable and must analyze everything. You have too many beliefs to analyze them one by one.

Descartes solves this by call into question the basis by which beliefs were acquired rather than targeting the beliefs themselves.

### First Target: The Senses
Descartes is going to call into question all beliefs derived from the senses. Unlike Locke, he is not going to take information derived from the senses for granted like Locke. There must be a way to show they are accurate.

The argument from sensory sensory deception:
1. The senses have deceived us in the past as a result of distance or weather.
2. If something has deceived you in the past, it should not be trusted going forward and the same is true for the senses.

Therefore, the senses should not be trusted under any circumstances, since they can and have deceived us.

The senses deceive us in suboptimal perceptual conditions like poor lighting or noisy rooms. If we can be deceived in these conditions, perhaps we should not trust them under these conditions, but why doubt the senses when perceptual conditions are optimal?

> For example, there is the fact that I am here, sitting by the fire, having this paper in my hands... how can I deny that these hands and body are mine?

Why should we doubt our judgements based on optimal perceptions like these?

**The Dream Argument:**

> How often has it happened to me that in the night I drempt that I found myself in a particular place, that I was dressed and seated by the fire, whilst in reality I was lying undressed in the bed.

Descartes has drempt that this kind of thing has gone on before, and if I was dreaming it, it was not true. Even optimal perceptions can be inaccurate.

How do you know that you are not dreaming now? You think that everything is optimal and that our judgments are trustworthy. Unless we can rule out the possibility that we are dreaming, there is no way to know.

We seem confident when we wake from a dream that it was only a dream. While in the dream, however, we seem equally confident about our circumstances. We are fully convinced that what is going on in the dream is what is going on in reality.

In order to be satisfied that we know what is going on in our environment as we experience it through our senses, it is essential to rule out the possibility that we are dreaming, but there is no way to dismiss this possibility.

Descartes makes this explicitly clear:

> In dwelling carefully on this, there is no certain indications by which we can clearly distinguish wakefulness from sleep.

There is no conceivable test that could be applied, since anything you can do in real-life you could be doing in a dream.

This issue undermines all sensory perception.

### A Reconstruction of the Dream Argument:
1. For any perceptional belief x, one must know that one is not dreaming x (premise 1)
2. No-one truly knows that they are not dreaming x. (premise 2)
3. Therefore, we don't know x for certain. (Conclusion)

All beliefs derived from sensory experience are suddenly thrown into question. This is a skeptical argument because it is designed for a purpose, to induce doubt.

If the argument is successful, we have a good general grounds for calling sensory perception into question. He is weeding out all beliefs rooted in sensory perception.

Descartes suggests there are somethings even if we don't know whether we are dreaming. Even if dreams give false representations, mustn't there be certain general concepts, simple, universal concepts which are true even in dreams?

Size, shape, extension and quantity are certainly true regardless of whether we are dreaming.

There must be concepts of shape and quantity even in a dream. In a dream about physical objects like horses, there must be some concept of corporeal, bodily nature. You cannot dream about horses without the concepts of shape and quantity, for example.

Geometrical and mathematical knowledge cannot fail, according to Descartes. These are **A Priori Knowledge**. Knowledge that is independent of sensory experience. Knowledge based on reason rather than sensory experience.

You do not need to look at every square to know that it will have four sides. We don't need sensory experience, only knowledge. For an arithmetical equation, we know `2 + 3 = 5`. We don't need to try this for 3 + 2 apples or oranges, we know it holds for all objects.

But Descartes puts even these in question. While he is confident that a square will not have 4 sides, could it not be that he was made by God that makes him err even in his most confident beliefs?

God could have made people so that they are always wrong. As a good Christian, he believes that God is perfect and would not have made him such that he would go wrong in even the most obvious things. This is incompatible with God's goodness.

But why does he ever go wrong if God made him? Would God's goodness not make him never err? If he has ever believed false things, then how can he appeal to God to have made him correctly?

Instead of supposing an infinitely good God who makes people never go wrong, he supposes that:

> some evil genius who is no less powerful than deceitful, has employed his whole energies in deceiving me.

He is concerned about sliding back into the prejudices of his education and sensory experiences. He needs a way to make sure of what is actually doubtful. 

**Skepticism** is the view that knowledge of truth is unattainable. We cannot know truths about the external world. (local version)

A broader view is that we cannot know anything at all (global version), even A Priori Knowledge.

We live our lives with our beliefs, but we never actually know that they are true according to skeptics.

What is it to say we know something? In order for a belief to qualify as a piece of knowledge, first:

1. x must be true. You cannot know things that are false, so they must first be a true belief.
2. x must be justified in thinking that it is true. A belief must be true, but it must have appropriate grounds for being thought to be true. Otherwise you could hold true beliefs but just be making lucky guesses. This is not knowledge that you picked the right multiple choice answer if you just guessed.

Skeptics deny part 2. They don't claim that there is no such thing as truth, they claim that we are never adequately justified in thinking that our beliefs are true and cannot therefore amount to knowledge.

Descartes is not a skeptic, as part of his method of doubt he has denied many things, but he exercises in trying to overcome his skeptical arguments.

## Epistemology: Rationalism
Descartes Second Meditation is a Partial Answer to Skepticism. Descartes is not a skeptic. The method of doubt is then a means of ensuring our justifications for our knowledge claims meet a very high standard above lucky guesses or highly probable opinions.

Descartes wants to say that our justifications must yield certainty. The justifications that we arrive at must remove any and all possibility of doubt and be immune to dreams, deceiving gods, and others.

Descartes finds a belief that cannot be doubted:

> I am, I exist.

Descartes is sure this is not susceptible to doubt. You cannot doubt your own existence. The very process of doubting suffices to affirm the truth of this belief.

> I am, I exist, is necessarily true each time that I pronounce it, or that I mentally conceive it.

If you try to doubt your own existence, then you exist, since you exist to doubt it, therefore you must exist.

### Knowledge of Mind
Descartes uses this knowledge to reach further conclusions. There are a variety of truths in the *I* of *I Exist*. There is a person's mind and a person's body. The *I* cannot be equated with the body. While we know our mind exists, the existence of our body is still not with certain known to be true.

The *I* cannot therefore be equated with the body and must be distinct. The *I* must be something that thinks. It is a mind, a soul, a reason.

The *I* is then:

> A thing which thinks, a thing which doubts, understands, conceives, affirms, denies, wills, refuses, and also imagines and feels.

The *I* is essentially a mind, a thing that thinks. All of these processes listed can be known to exist with certainty. If we affirm something, it is known to be true that we are affirming something.

This is the **Transparency of the mental:**

Our knowledge of our own minds and our current mental state is direct and unerring. The window into our own mind is transparent. We know what we are doing in our own minds.

From the standpoint of the ordinary person, it is the prejudice of common sense that the kinds of things we know best are the things that we observe each day. 

Is it true that what we know best is our own minds? Or is it our body that we know best? He says, no, sensory experience is untrustworthy. Trust the mind over the body.

Unlike the empiricists, he treats sensory experience with suspicion and does not trust it.

Descartes considers a piece of beeswax. What we know about the physical environment is prejudiced. An empiricist would say that the qualities revealed of the wax are its sweet taste, yellow colour, shape and size, solidity, all sensory qualities.

But place the wax near the fire and all of the sensory qualities change and disappear. Once placed near the fire, you know it's the same piece of wax, but all of the sensory components that would make it a piece of wax have changed.

Therefore, one cannot know the nature of bodies through the senses. If it were through these senses, then we could rely on them as true and complete reports.

If we cannot know the nature of common objects through the senses, what do we know when we say we understand the nature of an object.

Descartes' answer creates a characterization of the piece of wax that is unchanging regardless of what could happen to it like the fire. He describes the wax as:

> a certain extended thing which is flexible and movable.

This is the right characterization of any material thing according to Descartes. They can be extended, are flexible, and are movable substances.

This kind of idea that bodies are extended, flexible, movable substances, could not have been derived from sensory experience.

The true characterization of the piece of wax was not conveyed by the senses because the idea is too large for the senses. The piece of wax is called *flexible*. We mean that it can take on many different shapes. We cannot have observed **all** of these shapes. That is impossible, but we know through reason that it is possible.

The senses are only capable of conveying finite information. The idea of an extended, flexible, movable substance is an infinite description and is therefore not conveyable through sensory experience.

### Innate Ideas
Descartes describes the clarified idea that the wax is movable, flexible, is an *intuition of the mind*. We gain this belief through the intellect of our mind, which is known to be reliable.

Grasped through reason, rather than sensory experience or the imagination. (Rationalism)

Innate ideas are conceptions that are imprinted on the mind even prior to sensory experience. A piece of wax is an extended, flexible thing is derived from the mind's innate ideas.

This is A Priori Knowledge, the knowledge that is intellectual in its nature and is not dependent on research into the world around us.

For Descartes, all knowledge must have an A Priori foundation. It must be derived from our rational factories rather than sensory.

Two fundamental innate ideas:

1. The idea of the mind as a *thinking thing*.
2. The idea of body as *extended substance*.

Descartes has proven the existence only of the mind at the close of Meditation 2. He has not proven the existence of simple everyday objects like beeswax.

Descartes wants to say that if there is a body, it will be a flexible, movable, extendable substance.
